"My name is (y/n)"
"I'd consider myself a pretty good student. I attended class, got good grades, and ended the semester with an admirable GPA."
"Though I wasn't entirely confident about it, I genuinely thought I had a shot at getting accepted into my dream school, UCLA."
""To become a Bruin... Honestly, that'd be a dream come true." I'd think."
"..."
"Unfortunately, life tends to not go the way I want it to."
"And today was no exception."
ax "(y/n), this way! My club's booth is just up ahead!"
mc "Alex, I told you, I'm not interested in joining any clubs this quarter! Just, let go of me already!"
ax "Hmm? Sorry, did you say something?"
mc "Tch. You'd think someone would change after these years, but you haven't grown at all."
mc "Well, not mentally, at least."
ax "Hmm... You're not wrong there."
mc "Oh, so you heard that?"
ax"Haha! Selective hearing, I guess!"
mc "Selective hearing my a**"
"This guy is Alexander, or Alex for short."
"As a result of our parents being close friends, he and I were introduced at a young age and pretty much grew up together."
"For better or for worse, we became each others' confidants. I knew all his ins and outs, and he knew mine."
"We did just about everything together, our bickering a result of how comfortable we are with each other."
"That is, until his family moved to a different state, and we spent the last four years just chatting online whenever we could."
mc "(It's been four whole years...)"
"He was so ecsatic when he found out I would be attending UCI, he wanted to meet up as soon as we could."
"Physically, Alex definitely changed over the years. Admittedly, for the better."
mc "(But my feelings for him...)"
ax "(y/n). (y/n), look, over there."
mc "What?"
"I turned to look in the direction he was pointing, only to see a group of girls chatting amongst themselves."
design "See that girl in the denim jacket?"
mc "Yea...?"
ax "..."
ax "I need her number."
mc "..."
mc "(My feelings for him definitely changed for the worse.)"
ax "I'm sorry (y/n), but I have to-"
mc "No no, by all means. Go ahead, I insist."
ax "Really? You won't miss me?"
mc "Absolutely not. In fact, please leave."
ax "Haha, harsh!"
"Letting out a little laugh, Alex let go of my arm and took out his phone, grooming his hair as he stared at his reflection."
"Once he was satisfied, the corners of his lips pulled into charming smile, and he strode to his target."
mc "(Finally...)" 
"I wrapped my hand around my arm, now free from the philanderer's grasp, and glanced around Aldrich Park."
"Today was the Involvement Fair, so the area was filled with booths and students."
mc "(Can't say this is my kind of scene.)"
"I didn't want to go, but Alex was insitent on making me join his club."
mc "(At least now, I can finally go back to my room...)"
"I let out a sigh, and began following a road that would hopefully lead me out of here."
yu "Hey, you!"
mc "..."
yu "Huh? Hellooo...?"
mc "..."
mc "(Just keep facing forward, and they'll just give up-)"
yu "Boo!"
mc "?!"
"I jolted back, path now blocked by a grinning girl with purple hair."
yu "Haha, gotcha!"
yu "No escaping from me now, alright?"
mc "(Damn. Foiled again...)"
yu "Hey, don't give me that look... Come on, just follow me for a sec, okay? There's this really cool club you should totally check out!"
mc "Umm... Sorry, but I'm actually not interest-"
yu "Nonsense! This way!"
"And just like that, she placed a hand on my back, and whisked me away."
mc "(Why me...)"

--whoa skip--

yu "Here we are!"
kd "Hmm..?"
"The girl brought me to a booth with a video game themed banner. There was a guy wearing a suit sitting behind it."
"He stared at me for a moment before turning to the girl."
kd "Yukiko, please tell me you didn't just abduct this person."
yu "Tooootally not! [they] came here out of their own free will! Right?"
mc "..."
kd "It certainly doesn't seem like it."
yu "Oh lighten up! I know how much you love people, so I brought you one!"
kd "Tch."
yu "Alright bud, I'll leave you in Kendrick's hands, alright? I've got some more hunting to do."
mc "(Wait, you're just going to leave me here?!)"
"Before I got to voice my thoughts, the girl named Yukiko ran away, leaving me with this Kendrick guy."
"He clicked his tongue."
kd "How unprofessional." 
mc "..."
mc "Umm..."
kd "..."
"He shot a sharp glance at me, and I awkwardly scratched my cheek."
mc "Can I just... go..?"
kd "..."
"He looked away for a moment, probably contemplating something. But soon after, he sighed and walked around the table, making his way towards me."
kd "I'm afraid not. I have a duty, and I am expected to fulfill it."
"I couldn't help but let out a sigh." 
kd "... Seeing as you're less than enthusiastic about this, I suppose there's no point in asking you what you'd like to know."
kd "Please, bear with me while I go over the activities and goals of this club. I'll try to keep it short."
mc "Alright... Fine by me, I guess."
"He cleared his throat."
kd "We are known at the Video Game Development Club, or the VGDC for short."
kd "No matter the major of the individual, this club is open to anyone and everyone interested in producing video games."
kd "There are six departments: programming, art, writing, audio, production, and design. I, personally, am part of the production department."
mc "Unsurprising..."
kd "We- of different skill levels, both beginner and seasoned- gather and formulate teams. From there, each team creates their own game."
mc "..."
kd "And that's the main gist of it. Would you happen to be interested in joining?"
mc "Hmm..."
mc "That... hoenstly sounds really cool."
kd "Oh?"
mc "But, I actually kinda planned to not join any clubs my first quarter here."
kd "... I see."
mc "Yea. I'm sorry, but I'm going to get going now."
kd "DBH 1412"
mc "Huh?"
kd "That's where the club meets. If you ever change your mind, there will likely be an officer there that can help you."
mc "Oh. Uh, alright. Thank you..."
"He gave a curt nod before returning back to his post, and I took this as my cue to leave."
mc "He seemed... nice?"
mc "..."
mc "(That suit is seriously overkill for a casual involvement fair, though...)"

--skiiiiiiiiipsaosdmcks-

"--A few days later--" 
mc "..."
"I've gotten through my first academic week here in UCI. Classes are faced paced, but nothing I can't work with."
"I'm completing my work, attending my classes, and reading on my free time. The quarter is going smoothly, so everything should be fine as is. But..."
mc "(I'm boored...)"
"Everything is routine. The first week was so mundane, I actually regret not taking a closer look at the booths during the involvement fair."
mc "(A club...)
mc "..."
mc "(That suit guy said VGDC met in DBH 1412, right?)"
"I thought for a minute. It wouldn't hurt to give it a shot, would it?"
"Making up my mind, I picked my book up from the table and made my way towards the game room"

--Skip to Aldrich Park--

mc "Let's see..."
"I was walking through Aldrich Park, inputing DBH on the Zotfinder app to guide me."
"The park had been relatively empty, so I didn't bother looking up and see where I was going."
mc "DBH... Ah, it should be up a- woa!"
"Something hit my arm, hard."
"Next thing I knew, I was on the floor, my phone and book joining me on the cold, hard ground."
mc "Ow.. Who the heck..?"
mc "!!"
"I looked up to find a tall boy staring down at me."
"Our eyes met, and he immediately smiled, kneeling down to pick up the book that fell from my hand."
mc "Umm.. Thank you.."
"I reached out, expecting him to hand me the book. But instead, he continued to stare at the cover."
mc " ...?"
jd ".. Oh, sorry."
"He looked up and apologized, as if he only just remembered I was there."
"Placing the book in my hand, he flashed a smile so beautiful, my heart skipped a beat."
mc "(Holy shi-)"
jd "I apologize for bumping into you. And..."
jd "... you have really good taste for books."
mc "..."
"With that, he simply stood up and left."
"I turned and stared at his retreating form, completely under whatever spell the guy casted on me."
mc "I have no idea who he is, but..."
mc "...He's definitely easy on the eyes."
"I probably sat there for half a minute until someone walked by, staring at me."
mc "Oh."
mc "Oh shoot-!"
mc "(Right, I had somewhere to go!)"
"I hurriedly picked up my phone and got up." 
"After brushing myself off for good measure, I went on my way."
