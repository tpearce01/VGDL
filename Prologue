"My name is (y/n)"
"I'd consider myself a pretty good student. I attended class, got good grades, and ended the semester with an admirable GPA."
"Though I wasn't entirely confident about it, I genuinely thought I had a shot at getting accepted into my dream school, UCLA."
""To become a Bruin... Honestly, that'd be a dream come true." I'd think."
"..."
"Unfortunately, life tends to not go the way I want it to."
"And today was no exception."
design "(y/n), this way! My club's booth is just up ahead!"
mc "Alex, I told you, I'm not interested in joining any clubs this quarter! Just, let go of me already!"
design "Hmm? Sorry, did you say something?"
mc "Tch. You'd think someone would change after these years, but you haven't grown at all."
mc "Well, not mentally, at least."
design "Hmm... You're not wrong there."
mc "Oh, so you heard that?"
design "Haha! Selective hearing, I guess!"
mc "Selective hearing my a**"
"This guy is Alexander, or Alex for short."
"As a result of our parents being close friends, he and I were introduced at a young age and pretty much grew up together."
"For better or for worse, we became each others' confidants. I knew all his ins and outs, and he knew mine."
"We did just about everything together, our bickering a result of how comfortable we are with each other."
"That is, until his family moved to a different state, and we spent the last four years just chatting online whenever we could."
mc "(It's been four whole years...)"
"He was so ecsatic when he found out I would be attending UCI, he wanted to meet up as soon as we could."
"Physically, Alex definitely changed over the years. Admittedly, for the better."
mc "(But my feelings for him...)"
design "(y/n). (y/n), look, over there."
mc "What?"
"I turned to look in the direction he was pointing, only to see a group of girls chatting amongst themselves."
design "See that girl in the denim jacket?"
mc "Yea...?"
design "..."
design "I need her number."
mc "..."
mc "(My feelings for him definitely changed for the worse.)"
design "I'm sorry (y/n), but I have to-"
mc "No no, by all means. Go ahead, I insist."
design "Really? You won't miss me?"
mc "Absolutely not. In fact, please leave."
design "Haha, harsh!"
"Letting out a little laugh, Alex let go of my arm and took out his phone, grooming his hair as he stared at his reflection."
"Once he was satisfied, the corners of his lips pulled into charming smile, and he strode to his target."
mc "(Finally...)" 
"I wrapped my hand around my arm, now free from the philanderer's grasp, and glanced around Aldrich Park."
"Today was the Involvement Fair, so the area was filled with booths and students."
mc "(Can't say this is my kind of scene.)"
"I didn't want to go, but Alex was insitent on making me join his club."
mc "(At least now, I can finally go back to my room...)"
"I let out a sigh, and began following a road that would hopefully lead me out of here."
program "Hey, you!"
mc "..."
program "Huh? Hellooo...?"
mc "..."
mc "(Just keep facing forward, and they'll just give up-)"
program "Boo!"
mc "?!"
"I jolted back, path now blocked by a grinning girl with purple hair."
program "Haha, gotcha!"
program "No escaping from me now, alright?"
mc "(Damn. Foiled again...)"
program "Hey, don't give me that look... Come on, just follow me for a sec, okay? There's this really cool club you should totally check out!"
mc "Umm... Sorry, but I'm actually not interest-"
program "Nonsense! This way!"
"And just like that, she placed a hand on my back, and whisked me away."
mc "(Why me...)"
