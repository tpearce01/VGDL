mc “(So he's the guy I bumped into earlier...)” 

jd “Oh yeah, one more thing. This first meeting may not be too exciting, but 
I promise you that there will be invaluable experiences to gain,many joyous moments to come, 
and new friends to share those moments with.”

jd "So with that said, I hope that you will enjoy your journey here to the fullest.”

mc “(The way he speaks… it’s so familiar, but I can’t recall what it is.)”

mc “(The way that he is able to captivate the audience…)”

mc “(There is a weird, but definitely familiar feeling about him that perplexes me and I can’t seem to figure out!!)”

mc “(For some odd reason I can't stop gazing at him.)”

mc “(He’s so cu...I MEAN ODD. Yes, very odd…)”

mc “(Oh well, I shouldn’t think too much about it. Too much curiosity is always troublesome.)”

mc “(HUH?! Something poked me.)”

Ren "Hey, I didn't expect to see you here!"

"This is Ren. I haven't seen her since high school, but
she was like my bigger sister back then in high school. Always protecting me and taking care of me."

mc "Ren! It's been awhile!"

Ren "Yeah, it has been awhile. I've missed you kiddo."

Ren “So how do you like it here so far?”

mc “I like it a lot! The weather is nice, and the people are friendly!”

Ren "Anyway, I see that you are here now, so does that mean you are planning to join VGDC? 

mc "Yeah I was at their booth earlier and I wanted to check out their first club meeting."

Ren "You should definitely join!!"

Ren "Are you going to pitch a game idea for the next meeting? I think you should!”

mc "Yeah, I'm considering doing it, but will I have enough time or the ability to run a whole team?"

Ren "I believe you can do it. You are more than capable! And don't worry, if anything, I’ll personally be here to help you out."

mc "Thanks Ren, I’ll definitely consider it now.”

mc “(I really do miss talking to Ren.)”

"At that moment I saw him coming up towards us and Ren started to walk down towards him.”

jd "Hey Ren, I need to ask you something, can you come with me?

Ren "Yeah, I can, but what's up with the speech? You know this was only a VGDC meeting, not a presidential inauguration... Who are you trying to impress anyway?"

jd “I must make sure that the new members know how cool I am.”

Ren "That's pretty...cringe."

jd "Anyway, come with me for a sec."

Ren “You got it...”

mc “(So Ren knows him huh? Here’s my chance to have my curiosity satisfied! This is perfect!!)”

mc “HEY YOU!!”

mc “(...Wait where did they go?)”

mc "(Why did everyone turn their heads? Is there something interesting behind me?)"

Crowd “?...”

mc “(EHHH? WHY ARE THEY STARING AT ME?! WAS I THAT LOUD??)”
 
mc “(I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!)”

Crowd “Who was that?”

Crowd “That was pretty weird.. Who was” [they] “calling for?”   

#she/he gender

Crowd “Hey! Maybe” [she] “was calling for me because” [they] “thought I was cute!”

Crowd “No fool, you’re ugly.”

Crowd “Waah… you’re so mean.”

Scene 2:
#Setting: MC’s Apartment

mc “That was the most… EMBARRASSING MOMENT OF MY LIFE!!!”

mc “That was so embarrassing. Everything felt so embarrassing!!”

mc “Okay. Okay. Focus... I have to calm down and get work done. Get over it, let the past me worry about what happened.”

mc “Okay… time to get work done.”

mc “(Uh…now I’m getting really hungry and I haven’t eaten anything all day too. 
But the meeting ended so late so I didn’t have time to make food.)”

mc “Life at college...”

"My phone suddenly starts to ring. I'm pretty sure it's the old man calling me."

mc "Hello? Dad?”

Dad “Hi my wonderful child, it’s your amazing dad here. How was your first few days at school so far?”

mc “I’m hungry…”

mc “And you sound happy today, did something happen?”

Dad “Nothin’, your mom and I just had our anniversary today.”

Dad “Oh yeah, if you’re hungry, there’s food in the fridge. We came up to your area to eat for our anniversary, 
and we dropped by to say hi, but you weren’t there so we just dropped off some food for ya.”

mc “No way?! You are officially my favorite dad!”

Dad “I am your only dad…”

Dad “But your fridge is pretty empty! You need to take care of yourself and be more responsible for your health!”

mc “Yeah Dad, I know. I’ve just been a bit tight on my schedule, but I’ll be sure to stock up the fridge with food later.”

Dad “You know that boys won’t want you if you’re as skinny as a stick.”

mc “... No comment.”

Dad “Talking about boys, did you find a boyfriend yet?! Or maybe a girlfriend..?”

mc “...NO COMMENT!!”

Dad “Hahaha, I’m joking of course.”

mc “Oh yeah, there’s this boy, it’s weird, but I get a very familiar feeling coming from him as if I know him from somewhere long ago.”

mc “I wanted to ask him if we've met before but I missed my chance.”

Dad “I knew it!! There’s a boy HAHAHA. It’s been a week and you already found someone.”

mc “...Seriously, you’re an annoying boy stuck in an old man’s body. AND I DON’T LIKE HIM, I JUST WANT TO KNOW HIM!!”

Dad “I'm only joking! And yea if he makes you that curious, then you should definitely meet him.”

mc “Anything else you want to say old man?”

Dad “I just want to say, firstly, good luck with school and keep warm, the weather is getting colder.”

mc “Thanks Dad...Tell mo...”

mc "He... JUST HUNG UP ON ME?"

mc “That rotten old man! Didn’t even let me finish my sentence and just hangs up on. What kind of dad does that…”

"I headed to the fridge and grabbed the food that my parents brought for me."

mc “Thanks Mom and Dad…”

"After I finished eating, I took off my clothes, got into my bed, and put on my headphones. The soothing music starts to play,
as I begin to do some of my homework.”

"Eventually, my eyes start to tire. I put my work aside, laid down on, looked at the window, and as I listened to the music, 
his voice...started to run through my mind.)”

mc “(I really want to ask him…)”

mc “(Hey... you...)”

--black--

mc “OH SHOOT!! IT’S 8:15!”

mc “(I won’t make it to my 8 a.m class!! Damn… I forgot to set my alarm.)”

"Disappointed and sad, I slammed my head back into my pillow.”

#Setting: Anywhere on Campus
mc “(I missed my first class class today, but that’s okay. The notes are online so I should be fine.)”

mc “(What terrible luck… Whatever, I should find a place to study now.)”

mc “(Oh! I know where! Ren told me that Ayala Library is a great place to study and I haven’t been there yet either.)”

--black--

mc “(I think it should be around here somewhere…)”

mc “(Oh! I see it. Wow, it looks so nice from the outside…)”

"I then suddenly bumped into someone

Stranger “Oh, sorry. My apologies.”

mc “Oops! Sorry, let me pick up the water bottle for you...”

"As I return the water bottle, I look up and the person that I bumped into is none other than him!! The president of VGDC.”

mc “(What should I do or say?!)”

#[Player Options 1]----------------------------------------------

#[Hand back the bottle,say nothing, and walk away] (worst)------

"I immediately hand back the bottle and nervously walk off without saying a word.”

jd “Thank y...”

#[Get dramatic and tell him that he’s the worst kind of guy]  (middle)------

mc “Wait a minute, why am I, a girl, picking up the bottle for you who obviously bumped into me??”

mc “(WHAT AM I SAYING?! THIS IS NOT ME.)”

jd “My apologies. You picked up my bottle so fast that I didn’t even have time to react.”

jd “Thank you very much though.”

mc “(He looks so tall and handsome up close... Wait what?)”

mc “Uhhh you’re the worst kind of guys, just make sure to not get in my way next time Hmfph!”

mc “(Next time?! What am saying!?)”

"I start to quickly walk away."

#[Pretend to accidentally trip and sees if he catches you] (best)------

mc “Here’s your bott…”

“As I return the bottle to him, my legs start to feel weak. Suddenly, as if a ghost had possessed me,
my legs stumble and I fell toward him.”

jd “Oi, Are you okay?”	

“My mind went blank and I just blocked out all the noises. 
The only thing that I can think of is how his hands are holding onto mine."

mc “(He's so warm and his hands are soft. He smells nice too… Wait what?)”

“Suddenly, I snapped out of my delusional state and realize what had just happened.”

mc “Hahaha! I’m very sorry!”

jd "It's oka..."

"After nervously apologizing, I got up and quickly walked away.”

#Setting: Outside

mc “I can’t believe that just happened!! That was extremely awkward…”

mc “(Why did I do that... at first I wanted to meet him, and when I met him, I become a nervous wreck.)”

mc “(It’s okay! It’s over now. I need to focus and get some work done.)”

#Setting: ayala

mc “(This library is so nice. It looks so modern and it feels so comfortable.)”

mc “(Hmmm, now to find a table to sit at... oh there’s another room in here.)”

"I sat down and then as unpacked my stuff, I looked across from me and he was there! Again!”

mc “He’s reading his book so he doesn’t notice me yet. What should I do?!)”

"I quickly hid my face behind my textbook before he could notice me."

mc “(Okay, no problem. This is fine. It’s not awkward at all. We’re just two people studying at the same table.)”

"A few minutes pass by as I try to study."

mc “(This feeling is so tense... how am I supposed to focus?! I wonder if he’s looking at me. Should I peek to see if he is
or should I just leave??)”

[Player Options 2]----------------------------------------------

---[Definitely peek] (best)---

mc “(Okay. Just a really, really brief peek.)”

“(you peek at him)”

mc “(Wow.... His face, resting gently on his silky fingers. He looks so elegant...)”

mc “(STOP PEEKING THIS IS NO TIME TO CHECK HIM OUT!!)”

mc “(You’re right myself...but I must peek again!!)”

mc “(He’s not looking at all, or maybe he is indirectly looking and he can actually see me peeking at him! This guy is so sly.)”

mc “(AH! I know a way to test this.)”

"I gently put my book down, with my face looking down. I then softly yawn."

mc “(If he yawns then that means that he’s definitely looking at me! Hehe, I’m a genius!)”

"He then yawns almost instantly!"

mc “HA I KNEW IT!”

"He then gives off a small smirk."

mc “(Did he just smirk at me!? This arrogant guy...)”

"Before I noticed, the people in the room were all staring at me except for him."

mc “(Wait… Why is everyone looking at me?)”

mc “(OH NO, I DID IT AGAIN!! ME AND MY BIG MOUTH. I NEED TO LEAVE.)”

--black--

mc “(That was so embarrassing! I got played by that fool!!)”

---[Hell no, get the heck out of there!!] (worst)---

mc “(I can’t believe he’s here again. I’m definitely leaving.)”

"I got up and left."

mc “(That guy thinks he’s so cooool, but he’s so annoying and that dumb smile of his…)”

mc “(I need to get back on track though and study...)”

mc “(I’ll definitely get him back for this.)”

“I studied for awhile until I was caught up."

mc “(I think that’s enough studying for today. I caught up with my class so that’s a relief.)”

mc “(I’m getting kinda hungry though. Oh yeah, VGDC is having a fundraiser and they’re selling food at their booth.)” 

mc “(I should drop by and support them. Maybe Ren will give me a discount hehe.)”

mc “(Hopefully he’s not there running the booth or something. I can’t stand seeing him again.)”

#outside anywhere

mc “(I think the booth is on ring road somewhere… )”

mc “(Oh there it is!)”

“I walked towards the VGDC booth.”

Ren “Hey! What the? Why do you look like a starving child! I can’t have that. Here, take this. I already paid for it”

“Ren handed me a plate full of freshly made food!!”

mc “Ren… thank you so much!!!”

Ren “Hahaha, no worries kiddo.”

mc “(For some reason, I had a feeling that he was going to be here, but thank goodness he’s not.)”

mc “(What am I saying?? Why should it matter to me if he’s here or not.)”

mc “(Anyway, I kinda wanna get some exercise today. I wonder if there’s a park near by.)”

mc “Oh by the way Ren, is there a park near here?”

Ren “Yeah, there’s a park one mile going that way. Are you planning to chill there?”

mc “Yeah, I had a long, stressful, and embarrassing day.”

mc “Okay thank you Ren, I’m going to head over there, and thank you for the food!”

Ren “No problem kiddo.”

mc “(The park is on the way to my apartment, that’s perfect.)”

#player’s apartment

mc “(Let’s see… I should change first into something more comfortable.)”

mc “(Okay, that’s done, now I just need to grab my basketball and then I can head to the park.)”

#park

mc “(This park is amazing, there’s even a pond here! It’s so empty and quiet. Everyone must be too busy with school to 
have time to come here.)”

mc “(The quietness of the park creates such a relaxing atmosphere compared to the liveliness on Ring Road...)”

mc “(But sometimes I do prefer the solitude that quietness brings.)”

mc “(Wait... there’s actually someone here. Who is that over there?)”

mc “(Aww, that’s cute. It seems like they’re feeding the ducks.)”

mc “(No freaking way, it can’t be... It’s him again!? Why is he always at the same place that I am. Is he stalking me??)”

mc “(Should I confront him this time?)”

[Player Options 3]

[Yes, and make sure you show him who’s boss] (Best Choice + Bonus)

“I walk up to him to confront him."

mc “Hey you!!”

“He then looks at me.”

mc “(Oh crap! Maybe this is a bad idea. It’s too late now though!)”

mc “Why are you stalking me? You’ve been following around the whole day!”

mc “What is your purpose!?”

jd “Oh, it’s you, the one that yelled out loud at the library.”

mc “I DID NOT DO...”

mc “So you ARE stalking me!!”

jd “I mean... I can’t be the one stalking you if I’m always the one here before you.”

jd “So are YOU stalking me?”

mc “(He’s smiling at me! He’s ridiculing me! This guy pisses me off so much!!!)”

mc “Why you…”

mc “So you do notice me!”

jd “Of course I would notice my stalker.”

mc “(I swear this guy’s only job in life is to piss me off.)” 

mc “I’ll make you eat your words you smart ass!!”

mc “Play me one on one in basketball. If I win, you leave here immediately!”

jd “That’s fine. And if I win, you tell me your name, Stalker.”

mc “(That smirk of his, I’ll make sure to slam this ball onto his face.)”

"With force, I passed the ball to him.”

mc “Here! Take this. You start.”

jd “Nice pass.”

jd “Are you ready?”

mc “(Yeah, I’m ready to kick your ass.)”

"As I nod my head, a faint clap of thunder passes by.”

jd “Thunder…”

jd “Hey, I guess we’ll have to postpone our game.”

mc “(DAMN IT! Is it really going to rain. Cursed luck, I didn’t even bring an umbrella either.)”

mc “(Actually, if I run, I might be able to make it back before the rain hits!)”

"Suddenly, seconds after the roaring of the thunder, rain started to fall."

mc “(What the?! It’s raining already! What a splendid day... It couldn’t get any worse.)”

mc “(Something is covering me from the rain...)”

“He's holding an umbrella over my head.”

mc “(This guy... what does he want. He’s probably going to ask me if he can walk me home.)”

jd “I’ll walk you home.”

mc “(Who does this guy think he is?? He didn’t even ask me, he just demands that I walk home with him.)”

mc “No thanks. I’d rather stay in the rain.”

jd “Then I will stay here in the rain, together, with you.”

mc “(Huh??...)”

"Unexpected were his words as I turned my head to look at him."

mc “Who... is this guy.”

#settings: road?

"It was turning night. We walk home in silence as the rain falls. 
The sound of the rain brought a soothing quietness, but it did not bring solitude."

"He stood next to me, with his umbrella above us as we walk through our reflection on the concrete."

"The quietness wasn’t awkward between us, but instead it felt… comforting, as if two friends had reunited after years of isolation..."

"No words needed. The rain spoke for us."

"Once we arrived at my place, I turn to look up at him."

mc “Uh-um.. Thanks for walking me home.”

"As I turned around, I can see that annoying but beautiful smile of his from the corner of my eye."

jd “By the way. May I ask for you name?”

[Player Option 3.1(bonus)]----------

---[Run at him and whisper in his ears] (1st best)---

mc “(Whatever, I should just ignore him, he’s not worth my time.)”

jd “Hey do you need someone to play against?”

mc “(He wants to play?)”

mc “So you’re stalking me aren’t you?”

jd “I was here first, so I couldn’t have!”

mc "There will be an abnormal villain within your group of characters that can morph itself into anyone."

mc "The goal of this game is for the player to find the kidnapper as soon as possible..."

mc “Thanks Ren… Hi everyone, welcome to the first meeting. Let’s all work hard and do our best!”

mc “I’ll give everyone the full details of the game and then we can start by having the programmers set up gitHub.”

mc “I’ll need to talk to the artist and the writer to plan out the characters and stories.”

mc “Audio boy, you work your magic! Sounds good everyone?”

Members “Yea!”

mc “Then let’s get to work!”

mc “Hey jd, since we don’t have any writers… do you mind being our main writer?”

jd “Yeah, I don’t mind.”

mc “Thanks!”

mc  “By the way…”

jd “Yeah, what’s up?”

mc “Oh nevermind…”

mc “(I wanted to thank him for the meal last night, but I’m sure I don’t need to say anything.)”

mc “Okay Ren and jd so about the characters, can you guys talk to each other and come up with designs for the characters….”

jd “That shouldn’t be hard. But knowing Ren, I’ll end up coming up with the characters all by myself.”

Ren “That’s not true! You’re the one that relied on me for all the characters last project!”

Ren “That reminds me! You owe me a dinner for the characters I drew for your group last project since you guys didn’t have an artist!”

jd “Oh yeah, I totally forgot about that! My bad Ren. I’ll cook you dinner tonight and bring it over.”

mc “(Ren and Jeorge get along so well.)”

mc “(We worked on the project for an hour. Throughout the hour of our meeting, I discussed my vision of the projects and questions that the members had.)”

mc “Alright everyone! Thank you for coming to today’s meeting. I’ll see everyone next meeting!”

mc “(That meeting went well…)”

Ren “Good meeting today kiddo!”

Ren “By the way, do you want to join us for dinner? It would be nice to have you and jd both come!”

Ren “My place has been a bit empty and boring lately…”

mc “(I shouldn’t...)”

mc “Sorry Ren, maybe next time! I have something that I have to do.”

Ren “I see. No worries! You’re welcome to come if by if you change your mind!”

mc “Thank you.”

mc “(Boy am I tired. I feel like I’m gonna…)”

Ren “Hey! Can you hear me??”

mc “(Is that Ren? Why do I feel so light-headed)”

mc “Ren? Is that you? What happened…”

Ren “You passed out right in front of me!”

mc “Oh… I guess I did. Just a bit tired, I’ll be okay.”

Ren “No way, you are not okay. You need to take better care of yourself.”

Ren “Here, hold onto my shoulders, I’ll carry you back home.”

mc “No, I’m okay really… “

mc “(She gave me a stare that is similar to that of a worried mother’s expression towards her child.”)

mc “...Thank you, Ren.”

#player’s Apartment

Ren “You’ve been working too hard on yourself…”

mc “Maybe just a little.”

mc “(I smiled and she gives me a long sigh.)”

Ren “Alright, you just lay down and close your eyes. I’ll cook you something to eat right now.”

mc “Wait, I’ll be okay. You have dinner plans with someone and you can’t miss that!”

Ren “Oh that? Don’t worry about it, he’ll understand. Rest up, I’ll cook you dinner tonight.”

mc “(Ren…)”

mc “(Why do you do this… for me?)”
Ren “Okay, the food is ready, let’s eat!”

Ren “Come on you lazy pig, get up.”

mc “Hey wait! Hey that tickles!”

mc “(Ren picked me up and carried me to dinner table.)”

mc “Wow! You cooked all of this for me??”

Ren “For US. I’m gonna eat your food with you! Oh yeah, make sure you sleep early tonight and not stay up late.”

Ren “I’m cooking your dinner so you better listen to what I say... OR else MUWAHAHA.”

mc “Already roleplaying as a witch for Halloween I see.”

Ren “What did you say?”

mc “N-nothing!”

mc “(We both laughed…  I’m so grateful to have such a good friend like you in this life...)”

#player’s apartment
Ren “Hey! Wake up! I’m here to cook you breakfast!

mc “(It’s 8 a.m and she’s already here knocking at my door....)”

mc “Why are you here so early!?.”

Ren “I must make sure that you are okay!”

mc “I've been okay...”

Ren “Better safe than sorry! You've also been overstudying, so I'm here to make sure you're staying healthy!"

Rne "And anyway, my apartment is lonesome, so I’m gonna crash here and hang out with you for the day!”

mc “(Even though it’s 8 a.m on a Saturday, I’m happy that Ren came. It does get pretty lonely sometimes.)”

mc “Okay, okay I’m going back to bed. Please, Just 10 more minutes. Or better yet, wake me up when you finish cooking. Thank you!”

Ren “....”

mc “(It's almost the end of the quarter and the club meetings are going well. We made a lot of progress so far and we’re on track to finish it by winter break.)”

mc “(Ren and I have also been getting extremely close.)"

mc "(After the incident where I fainted in front of her, she would always check up on me and take care of me.)”

mc  “(And as for J.D, I would always see him at club meetings and he would always make the meeting fun, interesting, and productive for everyone.)”

mc “(As I felt the stitches on the shirt that he sew back for me, memories of when I first met him at the park came back.)”

mc “(I haven’t seen him at the park since our first encounter...)”

Ren “Hey sleepyhead, wake up!”

mc “The quarter is ending soon…”

Ren “Yeah, time does fly by when you’re too busy.”

Ren “That’s why you have to take time away from your busywork and spend a little time enjoying ya self!”

mc “That’s easier said than done… being an adult requires us to uphold a lot of responsibilities. We actually have to worry about the future ahead of us now.”

mc “Work hard now and enjoy life later! That’s my motto.”

mc “Besides, it’s impossible for me to make time for relaxing since finals and projects are coming up.”

Ren “Well… that’s why I’m here! To find the time for you to relax instead of over studying. Haven’t you heard?? Too much studying is equal to ‘student dying’.”

mc “Haha, real funny. I’m gonna fail my exams because of you…”

Ren “You’re not wrong though. We do have a life ahead of us to worry about and we’re given great opportunities in life to do many great things…”

Ren “But sometimes we forget the things that are also important in our life, and sometimes we don’t realize it until it’s too late.”

mc “(Tears started to fall down her gentle face as she spoke. I can sense feelings of sincerity and regret coming from her.)”

mc “(What she said weren’t merely just words, but experiences. Experiences that she had gone through. Experiences that shouldn’t be taken lightly. Ren…)”

Ren “Work hard and enjoy life along the way with others! That’s my motto for sure.”

Ren “You also better take care of your health too! You can’t work hard or enjoy life if you’re always out of energy!

mc “Ren… fine, let’s relax then! You prepare the food and I’ll prepare… the Netfix!”

Ren “That’s what I like to hear!”

mc “How about you come back tomorrow night and I’ll cook you dinner to repay ya for all those times that you took care of me?”

Ren “That sounds great, but we’ll have to do it another day! Sadly, I’m going to be busy tomorrow. J.D and I made plans to go somewhere.”

mc “J.D huh… that’s fine! We’ll do it next time…”
 
Ren “Sorry about that kiddo!”

mc “No worries!”

Ren “Lunch is ready though! Let’s eat.”

mc “Thank you, Ren.”

--black--

“Ren left. The place feels a bit empty again. I guess humans are social animals… it does suck feeling lonely.”

“I guess Ren is right. You’re enjoying their company so much that when they leave, you just can’t help but get a little sad.”

“Our group’s last meeting is coming up… We finished the project and it’s works amazingly thanks to everyone’s hard work.”

“Oh, I know! I’ll cook everyone something nice and the last meeting can just be a hangout!”

Last Club Meeting

#setting: apartment

mc “The last meeting… I can’t believe it’s been a whole quarter already. Everyone worked so hard and the game came out nicely.”

mc “I hope they’ll enjoy my cooking. I mean, why wouldn’t they? I’m a pretty damn good chef. J.D seemed to enjoy it the last time I cooked for him...”

#setting: outside/lobby

“As I walk towards the room, I start to get that indescribable feeling… the feeling that you get when you know that a story is coming to an end. 
“I mean, it’s a good ending… but this might be the last time I’ll really get to be this close to everyone.”

“Then everyone will be going off to another group or doing their own thing next quarter. I know that we will all keep in touch, but we won’t be as close as we are now.”

#Enters the room

“Well, that’s part of the journey I guess. Let’s enjoy this last moment…”

mc “WHY ARE YOU THE ONLY ONE HERE??”

mc “Where’s everyone else??”

jd “Didn’t you see the group chat?”

“I pulled out my phone to check”

mc “Hey (y/n), Alex, me, and Melody are all going to be busy. We will not make it to the last meeting! Sorry! But we can hangout after finals! - Love ya, Ren”

mc “(Why didn’t I check my messages earlier…ughhh.)”

jd “You didn’t plan anything special before the meeting, did you?”

“I walked up to him and placed the box of food in front of him.”

mc “You’re eating all of that. By yourself.”

mc “I can’t believe that they all ditched the meeting… I really wanted to thank them for their hard work you know.”

“He starts to eat my food.”

jd “You’ll get to do it later, when we hang out after finals.”

mc “You’re… actually eating my food.”

jd “It’s pretty good. Your cooking tastes even better the second time. It’s a shame that the group’s not here to try it.”

mc “(Why am I blushing!?)”

#Player Option 
#option 1: Asks him if he really likes your cooking.

mc “Is it really that good?”

jd “Yeah, I love it.”

mc “Thanks.”

mc “...Why did you come if you knew that everyone else wasn’t coming?”

jd “I am the group’s main buddy officer so it’s my duty to be here at this final meeting to thank you for an amazing quarter and congratulate you for your hard work.”

jd “Also... I didn’t want you to be here alone all by yourself.”

mc “I… Thanks.”

“I sat down, across from him.”

mc “Since no one is here, I guess I’ll just give you my thanks. Good luck on your finals.”

jd “Hey.”

“I turned back around and looked at him.”

jd “Let’s finish our one on one match today.”

mc “Now you finally want to lose?”

jd “Let’s see if you’ll still say that after the game.”

mc “You’re on.”

jd “Before that, here.”

“He hands me a wooden double picture frame.”

jd “I always get it for everyone in the group that I’m in. It’s like a souvenir... to remind them that they were a part of a wonderful journey.”

jd “The other one is special. I got it for you as a personal thank you for holding the team together and creating a memorable experience for all of us.” 
“I hadn’t expected this at all… I was awed. I looked at him in the eyes and he gently smiles back.”

mc “Thanks…”

#option 2: Try to invite him over to your place. #Best

mc “Is it really that good?”

jd “Yeah, I love it.”

mc “Anyway… why did you come if you knew that everyone else wasn’t coming?”

jd “I am the group’s main buddy officer so it’s my duty to be here at this final meeting to thank you for an amazing quarter and congratulate you for your hard work.”

jd “Also... I didn’t want you to be here alone all by yourself.”

mc “Thanks... actually, come with me!”

jd “Where do you want to go?”

mc “We’re going to my place.”

jd “Huh… What??”

mc “Come on, let’s go. I want you to try something.”

“Like a spirit had possessed, I grabbed him by the hand and dragged him to come with me”

jd “Hey wait! We can take my car, it’ll be faster...”

#Player’s apartment

jd “So this is your apartment... It’s so empty, don’t you get a bit lonely?”

mc “So will putting a giant teddy bear in that corner make it less lonely, huh??”

mc “(This guy… already criticizing my place. He’s getting me angry again.)”

mc “(No s**t it gets a bit lonely when you live by yourself.)”

jd “I like it actually. Simple and spacious, yet elegant. But I think it needs a little something…”

“He pulls out an object and then places it on my table next to my laptop.”

jd “Some objects are good to keep around. It reminds you that you are never alone in this world.”

mc “Since when did you get that?”

“The item that he placed on my table was a picture of our group together.”

jd “I always get it for everyone in the group that I’m in. It’s like a souvenir... to remind them that they were a part of a wonderful journey.”

jd “This one... is special.”

mc “(There’s something behind it…)”

“He opens the the second frame underneath the first frame to reveal another picture. It was a double picture frame.”

mc “That’s.... us…”

“It was a picture of me staring at him angrily during a group meeting. My irritated eyes glaring at him and his subtle posture. Ren took this picture.”

jd “I like this one. I got it for you as a personal thank you for holding the team together and creating a memorable experience for all of us.” 

“I was shook. Words did not come to me. I did not expect this. As I stare at the pictures, I wanted to thank him, but I couldn’t say a word. I only shed a few tears.”

jd “Oh yeah, did you want to show me something? Sorry for stealing the show.”

“I finally snapped out of my trance and wiped the few tear drops off my face.”

mc “Sorry, I got a bit distracted. Thank you very much for the gift…”

mc “Okay! Sit down and relax. I’m going to make food for you to repay you for the meal at the start of the year.”

jd “This is rare so I guess I’ll accept your offer.”

“I looked at him in the eyes and he gently smiles back. As the night went on we talked to each other endlessly as we ate. I was getting to know him more and… it was nice.

jd “That was really good. Thank you for the meal.”

mc “No worries.”

jd “It’s been a whole quarter already huh?...”

mc “Yeah… are you leaving now?”

jd “Is that your basketball over there?”

mc “Yeah.”

“He didn’t answer my question but instead grabs my hand.”

jd “Let’s go, I want you to see something.”

mc “Huh?”

“He picks up the basketball.”

jd “I wanna show you what a real winner looks like.”

“He passes the basketball to me.”

mc “Ah I see. You’re on. We’ll finish our match tonight.”

“Our eyes crossed and this time… I smiled back at him.”

#Park Scene

Setting: Park

jd “Are you ready to lose? You start.”

“He passes the ball to me.”

mc “You’re gonna eat those words.”
mc “(He’s playing extremely aggressive. I guess he really wants to win. I won’t let him.)”

“It felt refreshing as we played.  I don’t want to lose… I don’t want this day to end.”

mc “(There! An opening.)”

jd “Not even close.”

“He predicted my movements and blocks me.”

mc “Not bad…”

jd “Try to defend this.”

mc “(He’s fast!)”

“I was able to catch up and defend him from going to the rim but then he pulls up and makes a jump shot.”

jd “1-0.”

mc “That was pretty lucky. I didn’t expect you to make that.”

“Once get got the ball back he quickly 

mc “You know what they call me… the Handle God.”

“I quickly crossed him over with ease and laid up the ball into the basket.”

mc “Too easy. You can’t guard me!”

jd “Let’s see you do that again.

“I did the same thing once again, but this time he swiftly moved back and tries to block me, but this time I reversed my layup and scored once again.”

“Our bodies made contact during the shot and as I landed I felt a stinging pain coming from my left foot and I yelled out in pain.”

jd “Hey are you okay??”

mc “Scored and one.”

“He just slightly laughs and carried me over to a bench. We sat down on the bench.”

jd “Let me see your foot.”

mc “It’s fine, just a tiny sprain, I get them all the time. I can still walk fine, it just hurts a little.”

jd “Well, I guess the game is over...”

mc “Then I win.”

jd “Then I guess you win the bet. I’ll leave you alone in here now.”

“I grabbed him by the arm. He turns and looks me in the eyes.”

mc “So you’re just going to leave me here, at night, after you injured me?!”

jd “I’m joking, I’m joking. Hahaha.”

jd “It’s been a whole quarter already huh? Sorry it took this long for our rematch.”

mc “Don’t worry, I understand. Ren told me that you’re always busy so it only makes sense.”

mc “So what are you going to do during winter break? Are you gonna go home?”

jd “This place is like home to me so I’ll be staying here for the break. How about you?”

mc “I live up north so I’ll be heading back there to my family during the break...”

“We sat on the bench silently for the next minute. He then broke the silence.”

jd “How’s your dad like?”

mc “(Huh? That’s a weird question…)”

mc “Uhmm… he’s just a uhhh… regular, nosy, old fool that always try to piss me off!!”

mc “(Thinking about him is making me annoyed.)”

jd “Oh I see. Hahaha.”

mc “But I guess he’s wise and caring… sometimes.”

mc “(I wonder why he’s asking about my dad… I should ask him about his dad.)”

mc “How’s your dad like?”

jd “We were never close...”

mc “Oh… I’m sorry to hear that. Maybe you can use this winter break to get closer to him.”

jd “If you tried your best to help someone but they refuse to accept your help, will you ever give up on them?”

mc “If you know that you will never forgive yourself for giving up on them… then you should never let go of them.”

mc “Maybe they’re lonely… and they need someone to clear those gray clouds of loneliness.”

jd “I see…”

“He then grabs my arms and put them around his neck.”

jd “I’ll take you home.”

mc “I can walk on my own you know...”

jd “I know.”

“He carried me on his back. My arms around his warm neck. His warm body against mine. The weather is getting colder.”

mc “(Always playing the prince while I play the princess in distress…)”

“Just like then… quiet but comforting. I couldn’t help but to smile as I rest my head onto his shoulders.”

--black-- 

“Suddenly, a black car stops in front of us, blocking us from moving forward.”

“A man around my dad’s age came out of the car. Exiting the passenger side was a woman... “

mc “(It’s Ren!)”

“J.D looks at the man. Their eyes met, a cold stare that I have never seen before, came from J.D. Serious wouldn’t describe the look in his eyes, it was more of hatred.”

“I wanted to ask him about the situation… but I couldn’t. It wasn’t my place to say anything.”
jd “Ren, can you take (y/n) home.”

Ren “Yeah.”

“Ren then came over and took me from J.D’s shoulders.”

mc “It’s okay Ren, I can walk.”

Ren “Nope. I got you!”

“She wrapped my arms around her neck and carried me on her back.”

mc “(Stubborn just like J.D… I’m thankful for friends like you guys.)”

Ren “Don’t worry, I’ll explain everything once we get home.”

“I looked at J.D and the mysterious man. Their eyes still glaring at one another without a single word. Is it his father? Why was Ren with him…?”

Ren “Yeah, J.D and I are siblings… well, he’s my stepbrother.”

Ren “Why? Did you think we were… perhaps, lovers?”

“She starts so laugh. I on the other hand, was shook. I couldn’t believe what she had told me.”

mc “You guys are siblings?? You never told me this!!”

Ren “I thought you knew… hahaha.”

mc “You told me you had plans with him so I thought you two… like each other…”

Ren “Oh that… we were just planning to visit our mom in the hospital like usual. Here, sit down, drink some water, and I’ll explain to you everything…”
