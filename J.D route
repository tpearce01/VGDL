DIALOGUE : 
Scene 1: 
#setting:lecture hall

mc “(So the guy I bumped into before is the president of this club...)” 

jd “Oh yeah, one more thing. This first meeting may not be too exciting, but I promise you that there will be invaluable experiences to gain,many joyous moments to come, and new friends to share those moments with..”

jd "So with that said, I hope that you will enjoy your journey here to the fullest.”

mc “(The way he speaks… it’s so familiar, but I can’t recall what it is.)”

mc “(The way that he is able to captivate the audience…)”

mc “(There is a weird, but definitely familiar feeling about him that that perplexes me and I can’t seem to figure out!!)”

mc “(For some odd reason I can't stop gazing at him.)”

mc “(He’s so cu...I MEAN ODD. Yes, very odd…)”

mc “(Oh well, I shouldn’t think too much about it. Too much curiosity is always troublesome.)”

mc “(HUH?! Something poked me.)”

Ren "Hey, I didn't expect to see you here!"

mc “(Oh it's Ren! I haven't seen her since high school. She was like my bigger sister back in high school. She would always protect me.)”

mc "Ren! It's been awhile!"

Ren "Yeah, it has been awhile. I've missed you kiddo."

Ren “So how do you like it here so far?”

mc “I like it a lot! The weather is nice, and the people are friendly!”

Ren "Anyway, I see that you are here now, so does that mean you are planning to join VGDC? 

mc "Yeah I was at their booth earlier and I wanted to check out their first club meeting."

Ren "You should definitely join! Take time away from your busywork and enjoy some time with your biggos here!"

Ren "Are you going to pitch a game idea for the next meeting? I think you should!”

mc "Yeah, I'm considering doing it, but will I have enough time or the ability to run a whole team?"

Ren "I believe you can do it. You are more than capable! And don't worry, if anything, I’ll personally be here to help you out."

mc "Thanks Ren, I’ll definitely consider it now.”

mc “(I really do miss talking to Ren.)”

mc “(At that moment I saw him coming up towards us and Ren started to walk down towards him.)”

jd "Hey Ren, I need to ask you something, can you come with me?

Ren "Yeah, I can, but what's up with the speech? You know this was only a VGDC meeting, not a presidential inauguration... Who are you trying to impress anyway?"

jd “I must make sure that the new members know how cool I am.”

“(jd smiles)”

Anyway come with me for a sec."

Ren “You got it...”

mc “(So Ren knows him huh? Here’s my chance to have my curiosity satisfied! This is perfect!!)”

mc “HEY YOU!!”

mc “(...wait where did they go?)”

“(a few people in the crowd turns and looks at you)”

Crowd “?...”

mc “(OH SHOOT! WHY IS EVERYONE STARING AT ME?! WAS I THAT LOUD?! THIS IS EMBARRASSING!!)”
 
mc “(I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!)”

Crowd “Who was that?”

Crowd “That was pretty weird.. Who was” [she] “calling for?”   

#she/he gender

Crowd “Hey! Maybe” [she] “was calling for me because” [she] “thought I was cute!”

Crowd “No fool, you’re ugly.”

Crowd “Waah… you’re so mean.”

Scene 2:
#Setting: MC’s Apartment

mc “That was the most… EMBARRASSING MOMENT OF MY LIFE!!!”

mc “(That was so embarrassing. Everything felt so embarrassing!!)”

mc “(Okay. Okay. Focus... I have to calm down and get work done. Get over it, let the past me worry about what happened.)”

mc “(Okay… time to get work done.)”

“(Your stomach growls)”

mc “(Uh…now I’m getting really hungry and I haven’t eaten anything all day too. But the meeting ended so late so I didn’t have time to make food.)”

mc “Life at college...”

“(your phone rings)”

mc "Hello? Dad?”

Dad “Hi my wonderful child, it’s your amazing dad here. How was your first few days at school so far?”

mc “I’m hungry…”

mc “And you sound happy today, did something happen?”

Dad “Nothin’, your mom and I just had our anniversary today.”

Dad “Oh yeah, if you’re hungry, there’s food in the fridge. We came up to your area to eat for our anniversary, and we dropped by to say hi, but you weren’t there so we just dropped off some food for ya.”

mc “No way?! You are officially my favorite dad!”

Dad “I am your only dad…”

Dad “But your fridge is pretty empty! You need to take care of yourself and be more responsible for your health!”

mc “Yeah Dad, I know. I’ve just been a bit tight on my schedule, but I’ll be sure to stock up the fridge with food.”

Dad “You know that boys won’t want you if you’re as skinny as a stick.”

mc “... No comment.”

Dad “Talking about boys, did you find a boyfriend yet?! Or maybe a girlfriend..?”

mc “...NO COMMENT!!”

Dad “Hahaha, I’m joking of course.”

mc “Oh yeah, there’s this boy, it’s weird, but I get a very familiar feeling coming from him as if I know him from somewhere long ago.”

mc “Do you think I should ask him about it?”

Dad “I knew it!! There’s a boy HAHAHA. It’s been a week and you already found someone.”

mc “...Seriously, you’re an annoying boy stuck in an old man’s body. AND I DON’T LIKE HIM, I JUST WANT TO KNOW HIM!!”

Dad “Hahah, but yeah why the heck not? You guys probably met each other before.”

mc “Anything else you want to say old man?”

Dad “I just want to say, firstly, good luck with school and keep warm, the weather is getting colder.”

mc “Thanks Dad...Tell mo...”

“(Your dad hangs up the phone before you finish)”

mc “That rotten old man! Didn’t even let me finish my sentence and just hangs up on. What kind of dad does that…”

mc “(I grabbed the food and started eating.)”

mc “(Thanks Mom and Dad…)”

mc “(After I finished eating, I took off my clothes, got into my bed, and put on my headphones. The soothing music starts to play, as I begin to do some of my work.)”

mc “(Eventually, my eyes start to tire. I put my work aside, laid down on, looked at the window, and as I listened to the music, his voice...started to run through my mind.)”

mc “(I really want to ask him…)”

mc “(Hey... you…)”

“(*Beep Beep Beep*)”

mc “OH SHOOT!! IT’S 8:15!”

mc “(I won’t make it to my 8 a.m class!! Damn… I forgot to reset my alarm.)”

mc “(Disappointed and sad, I slammed my head back into my pillow.)”


Scene 3: 
#Setting: Anywhere on Campus
mc “(I missed my first class class today, but that’s okay. The notes are online so I should be fine.)”

mc “(What terrible luck… Whatever, I should find a place to study now.)”

mc “(Oh! I know where! Ren told me that Ayala Library is a great place to study and I haven’t been there yet either.)”

mc “(I think it should be around here somewhere…)”

mc “(Oh! I see it. Wow, it looks so nice from the outside…)”

mc “(Suddenly I bump into someone.)”

Stranger “Oh, sorry. My apologies.”

mc “Oops! Sorry, let me pick up the water bottle for you...”

mc “(As I return the water bottle, I look up and the person that I bumped into is none other than him!! The president of VGDC.”)

mc “(What should I do or say?!)”

[Player Options 1]

[Hand back the bottle,say nothing, and walk away] (worst)

mc “(I immediately hand back the bottle and nervously walk off without saying a word.)”

jd “Thank y...”

[Get dramatic and tell him that he’s the worst kind of guy]  (middle)

mc “Wait a minute, why am I, a girl, picking up the bottle for you who obviously bumped into me??”

mc “(WHAT AM I SAYING?! THIS IS NOT ME.)”

jd “My apologies. You picked up my bottle so fast that I didn’t even have time to react.”

jd “Thank you very much though.”

mc “(He looks so tall and handsome close up... Wait what?)”

mc “Uhhh you’re the worst kind of guys, just make sure to not get in my way next time Hmfph!”

mc “(Next time?! What am saying!?)”

mc “(I start to quickly walk away.)”

[Pretend to accidentally trip and sees if he catches you] (best)

mc “Here’s your bott…”

mc (“As I return the bottle to him, my legs start to feel weak. Suddenly, as if a ghost had possessed me, my legs stumble and I fell toward him.”)

jd “Oi, Are you okay?”	

mc “(My mind went blank and I just blocked out all the noises. The only thing that I can think of is how his arms are holding onto mine.)”

mc “(He looks so tall and handsome close up and he smells nice too… Wait what?)”

mc “(Suddenly, I snap out of my delusional state and realize what had just happened.)”

mc “Hahaha! I’m very sorry!”

mc “(After nervously apologizing, I got up and quickly walked away.)”

#cut
#Setting: Outside

mc “I can’t believe that just happened!! That was extremely awkward…”

mc “(Why did I do that…At first I wanted to meet him, and when I met him, I become a nervous wreck.)”

mc “(It’s okay! It’s over now. I need to focus and get some work done.)”

#Setting: ayala

mc “(This library is so nice. It looks so modern and it feels so comfortable.)”

mc “(Hmmm, now to find a table to sit at… oh there’s another room in here.)”

mc “(I sat down and then as I unpack my stuff, I look across from me and he was there again!)”

mc “He’s reading his book so he doesn’t notice me yet. What should I do?!)”

mc “(I quickly hid my face behind my textbook before he could notice me.)”

mc “(Okay, no problem. This is fine. It’s not awkward at all. We’re just two people studying at the same table.)”

mc “(A few minutes pass by as I try to study.)”

mc “(This feeling is so tense... how am I supposed to focus?! I wonder if he’s looking at me. Should I peek to see if he is or should I just leave??)”

[Player Options 2]

[Definitely peek] (best)

mc “(Okay. Just a really, really brief peek.)”

“(you peek at him)”

mc “(Wow.... His face, resting gently on his silky fingers. He looks so elegant like a beautiful swan resting alongside a riverbank…)”

mc “(STOP PEEKING THIS IS NO TIME TO CHECK HIM OUT!!)”

mc “(You’re right myself… but I must peek again!!)”

mc “(He’s not looking at all, or maybe he is indirectly looking and he can actually see me peeking at him! This guy is so sly.)”

mc “(AH! I know a way to test this.)”

mc “(I gently put my book down, with my face looking down. I then softly yawn.)”

mc “(If he yawns then that means that he’s definitely looking at me! Hehe, I’m a genius!)”

mc “(I slightly peek and he yawns!)”

mc “HA I KNEW IT!”

“(jd gives a slight chuckle)”

mc “(Did he just smirk at me?)”

“(The people in the room turns and looks at you except for jd)”

mc “(Wait… Why is everyone looking at me?)”

mc “(OH NO, I DID IT AGAIN!! ME AND MY BIG MOUTH. I NEED TO LEAVE.)”

“(You quickly exit the room.)”

mc “(That was so embarrassing! I got played by that fool!!)”

[Hell no, get the heck out of there!!] (worst)

mc “(I can’t believe he’s here again. I’m definitely leaving.)”

“(You exit the room)”

#cut
#library

mc “(That guy thinks he’s so cooool, but he’s so annoying and that dumb smile of his…)”

mc “(I need to get back on track though and study...)”

mc “(I’ll definitely get him back for this.)”

“(You study and a few hours pass by)”

mc “(I think that’s enough studying for today. I caught up with my class so that’s a relief.)”

mc “(I’m getting kinda hungry though. Oh yeah, VGDC is having a fundraiser and they’re selling food at their booth.)” 

mc “(I should drop by and support them. Maybe Ren will give me a discount hehe.)”

mc “(Hopefully he’s not there running the booth or something. I can’t stand seeing him again.)”

#outside anywhere

mc “(I think the booth is on ring road somewhere… )”

mc “(Oh there it is!)”

“(you walk towards the VGDC booth)”

Ren “Hey! What the? Why do you look like a starving child! I can’t have that. Here, take this. I already paid for it”

“(Ren hands you a plate of food)”

mc “Ren… thank you so much!!!”

Ren “Hahaha, no worries kiddo.”

mc “(For some reason, I had a feeling that he was going to be here, but thank goodness he’s not.)”

mc “(What am I saying?? Why should it matter to me if he’s here or not.)”

mc “(Anyway, I kinda wanna get some exercise today. I wonder if there’s a park near by.)”

mc “Oh by the way Ren, is there a park near here?”

Ren “Yeah, there’s a park one mile going that way. Are you planning to chill there?”

mc “Yeah, I had a long and stressful day.”

mc “Okay thank you Ren, I’m going to head over there, and thank you for the food!”

Ren “No problem kiddo.”

mc “(The park is on the way to my apartment, that’s perfect.)”

#player’s apartment

mc “(Let’s see… I should change first into something more comfortable.)”

mc “(Okay, that’s done, now I just need to grab my basketball and then I can head to the park.)”

#park

mc “(This park is amazing, there’s even a pond here! It’s so empty and quiet. Everyone must be too busy with school to have time to come here.)”

mc “(The quietness of the park creates such a relaxing atmosphere compared to the liveliness on Ring Road…)”

mc “(But sometimes I do prefer the solitude that quietness brings.)”

mc “(Wait… There’s actually someone here. Who is that over there?)”

mc “(Aww, that’s cute. It seems like they’re feeding the ducks.)”

mc “(No freaking way, it can’t be... It’s him again!? Why is he always at the same place that I am. Is he stalking me??)”

mc “(Should I confront him this time?)”

[Player Options 3]

[Yes, and make sure you show him who’s boss] (Best Choice + Bonus)

“(You walk up to jd)”

mc “Hey you!!”

“(jd looks at you)”

mc “(Oh crap! Maybe this is a bad idea. It’s too late now though!)”

mc “Why are you stalking me? You’ve been following around the whole day!”

mc “What is your purpose!?”

jd “Oh, it’s you, the one that yelled out loud at the library.”

mc “I DID NOT DO…”

mc “So you are stalking me!!”

jd “I mean… I can’t be the one stalking you if I’m always the one here before you.”

jd “So are you stalking me?”

mc “(He’s smiling at me! He’s ridiculing me! This guy pisses me off so much!!!)”

mc “Why you…”

mc “So you do notice me!”

jd “Of course I would notice my stalker.”

mc “(I swear this guy’s only job in life is to piss me off.)” 

mc “I’ll make you eat your words you smart ass!!”

mc “Play me one on one in basketball. If I win, you leave here immediately!”

jd “That’s fine. And if I win, you tell me your name, Stalker.”

mc “(That smirk of his, I’ll make sure to slam this ball onto his face.)”

mc “(With force, I pass the ball to him.)”

mc “Here! Take this. You start.”

jd “Nice pass.”

jd “Are you ready?”

mc “(Yeah, I’m ready to kick your ass.)”

mc “(As I nod my head, a faint clap of thunder passes by.)”

jd “Thunder…”

jd “Hey, I guess we’ll have to postpone our game.”

mc “(DAMN IT! Is it really going to rain. Cursed luck, I didn’t even bring an umbrella either.)”

mc “(Actually, if I run, I might be able to make it back before the rain hits!)”

mc “(What the?! It’s raining already! What a splendid day… It couldn’t get any worse.)”

mc “(Something is covering me from the rain...)”

“(jd holds up an umbrella over your head from behind)”

mc “(This guy… what does he want. He’s probably going to ask me if he can walk me home.)”

jd “I’ll walk you home.”

mc “(Who does this guy think he is?? He didn’t even ask me, he just demands that I walk home with him.)”

mc “No thanks. I’d rather stay in the rain.”

jd “Then I will stay here in the rain, together, with you.”

mc “(Huh… what?!?!)”

mc “(I turn my head to look at him… Who is this guy.)”

#settings: road?

mc “(It was turning night. We walk home in silence as the rain falls. The sound of the rain brought a soothing quietness, but it did not bring solitude.)” 

mc “(He stood next to me, with his umbrella above us as we walk through our reflection on the concrete.)”

mc “(The quietness wasn’t awkward between us, but instead it felt… comforting, as if two friends had reunited after years of isolation…)”

mc “(No words needed. The sound of the rain spoke for us.)”

mc “(Once we arrived in front of my place, I turn to look up at him.)”

mc “Uh-um.. Thanks for walking me home.”

mc “(He looks me in the eyes and smiles.)”

mc “(I turn around and start to walk away.)”

jd “By the way. May I ask for you name?”

[Player Option 3.1(bonus)]


[Run at him and whisper in his ears] (1st best)

mc “(I turn around and walk up to him. With my hands on his shoulders I 
whispered…)”

mc “My name is” [mc].

[Nah. You haven’t beaten me yet.”] (2nd best)

mc “You haven’t beaten me yet.”

mc “This bath feels so good!”

mc “Oh right! Pitch day is coming soon, I need to come up with a game idea soon…”


[Nah, just play ball and ignore him] (Worst Choice) (3.2)

mc “(I can’t believe he’s always at the same location that I am in.)”

mc “(Whatever, I should just ignore him, he’s not worth my time.)”

jd “Hey do you need someone to play against?”

mc “(He wants to play?)”

mc “So you’re stalking me aren’t you?”

jd “I was here first, so I couldn’t have!”

mc “(This guy…)”

mc “Fine, if I win, you leave.”

jd “Don’t worry, you won’t will.”

mc “(THIS GUY!!!)”

mc “(Was that thunder?)”

mc “(What the… it’s raining!? What is with the bad luck today! I didn’t even check the weather and I don’t even have an umbrella…)”

mc “Yes?”

jd “Do you need an umbrella?”

mc “No… I’m good, I’d rather walk in the rain. Thanks for the offer.”

jd “Are you sure?”

mc “Yeah. Stop bothering me!”

mc “(What the? Why does he want to know my name for!?)”

mc “My name is” + [mc]

mc “I’ll need to talk to the artist and the writer to plan out the characters and stories.”

mc “Audio boy, you work your magic! Sounds good everyone?”

Members “Yea!”

mc “Then let’s get to work!”

mc “Hey jd, since we don’t have any writers… do you mind being our main writer?”

jd “Yeah, I don’t mind.”

mc “Thanks!”

mc  “By the way…”

jd “Yeah, what’s up?”

mc “Oh nevermind…”

mc “(I wanted to thank him for the meal last night, but I’m sure I don’t need to say anything.)”

mc “Okay Ren and jd so about the characters, can you guys talk to each other and come up with designs for the characters….”

jd “That shouldn’t be hard. But knowing Ren, I’ll end up coming up with the characters all by myself.”

Ren “That’s not true! You’re the one that relied on me for all the characters last project!”

Ren “That reminds me! You owe me a dinner for the characters I drew for your group last project since you guys didn’t have an artist!”

jd “Oh yeah, I totally forgot about that! My bad Ren. I’ll cook you dinner tonight and bring it over.”

mc “(Ren and Jeorge get along so well.)”

mc “(We worked on the project for an hour. Throughout the hour of our meeting, I discussed my vision of the projects and questions that the members had.)”

mc “Alright everyone! Thank you for coming to today’s meeting. I’ll see everyone next meeting!”

mc “(That meeting went well…)”

Ren “Good meeting today kiddo!”

Ren “By the way, do you want to join us for dinner? It would be nice to have you and jd both come!”

Ren “My place has been a bit empty and boring lately…”

mc “(I shouldn’t...)”

mc “Sorry Ren, maybe next time! I have something that I have to do.”

Ren “I see. No worries! You’re welcome to come if by if you change your mind!”

mc “Thank you.”

mc “(Boy am I tired. I feel like I’m gonna…)”

Ren “Hey! Can you hear me??”

mc “(Is that Ren? Why do I feel so light-headed)”

mc “Ren? Is that you? What happened…”

Ren “You passed out right in front of me!”

mc “Oh… I guess I did. Just a bit tired, I’ll be okay.”

Ren “No way, you are not okay. You need to take better care of yourself.”

Ren “Here, hold onto my shoulders, I’ll carry you back home.”

mc “No, I’m okay really… “

mc “(She gave me a stare that is similar to that of a worried mother’s expression towards her child.”)

mc “...Thank you, Ren.”

Ren “You’ve been working too hard on yourself…”

mc “Maybe just a little.”

mc “(I smiled and she gives me a long sigh.)”

Ren “Alright, you just lay down and close your eyes. I’ll cook you something to eat right now.”

mc “Wait, I’ll be okay. You have dinner plans with someone and you can’t miss that!”

Ren “Oh that? Don’t worry about it, he’ll understand. Rest up, I’ll cook you dinner tonight.”

mc “(Ren…)”

mc “(Why do you do this… for me?)”
Ren “Okay, the food is ready, let’s eat!”

Ren “Come on you lazy pig, get up.”

mc “Hey wait! Hey that tickles!”

mc “(Ren picked me up and carried me to dinner table.)”

mc “Wow! You cooked all of this for me??”

Ren “For US. I’m gonna eat your food with you! Oh yeah, make sure you sleep early tonight and not stay up late.”

Ren “I’m cooking your dinner so you better listen to what I say... OR else MUWAHAHA.”

mc “Already roleplaying as a witch for Halloween I see.”

Ren “What did you say?”

mc “N-nothing!”

mc “(We both laughed…  I’m so grateful to have such a good friend like you in this life...)”

Ren “Hey! Wake up! I’m here to cook you breakfast!

mc “(It’s 8 a.m and she’s already here knocking at my door....)”

mc “Why are you here so early!?.”

Ren “I must make sure that you are okay!”

mc “It’s been a week since I fainted... I think I’ll be okay.”

Ren “Better safe than sorry! Anyway, my apartment is lonesome, so I’m gonna crash here and hang out with you for the day!”

mc “(Even though it’s 8 a.m on a Saturday, I’m happy that Ren came. It does get pretty lonely sometimes.)”

mc “Okay, okay I’m going back to bed. Please, Just 10 more minutes. Or better yet, wake me up when you finish cooking. Thank you!”

Ren “....”

mc “(It’s been a few weeks so far and the club meetings are going well. We made a lot of progress so far and we’re on track to finish it by winter break.)”

mc “(Ren and I have also been getting extremely close. After the incident where I fainted in front of her, she would always check up on me and take care of me.)”

mc  “(And as for jd, I would always see him at club meetings and he would always make the meeting fun, interesting, and productive for everyone.)”

mc “(As I felt the stitches on the shirt that he sew back for me, the memories of when I first met him at the park came back.)”

mc “(I haven’t seen him at the park since our first encounter...)”
