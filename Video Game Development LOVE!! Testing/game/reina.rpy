     #[Option 1- Ask to talk to Reina]
     mc "(This is my only chance…! I’ve got to do it!)"
     mc "Excuse me, Reina?"
     re "Hmm?"
     mc "Well, I was just wondering, would you happen to be free right now?"
     "She tilted her head to the side in confusion."
     re "I am, yes… Why?"
     mc "Weeellll you see, I’m kiinda bored, and could use someone to talk to."
     mc "You think you can grace me with your presence for just a bit?"
     "Reina looked taken aback, and shifted her eyes away from me."
     re "U-Umm… I’m sorry, but, I’m not really all that good company…"
     re "But, uh, you can talk to anyone else here?"
     mc "Hmmm… I could, sure. But I only want to talk to you."
     "At that, she visibly blushed."
     re "Me? B-But--"
     mc "Hey, don’t be shy~ Sit with me, I promise you won’t regret it!"
     re "...."
     mc "Pleeeaaaase..?"
     re " … Nnn…"
     "After a moment of further hesitation, Reina eventually gave in and sat down across from me. I couldn’t help but grin."
     mc "Alright, sweet!"
     re "...."
     mc "So, tell me about yourself."
     re "...."
     mc "...."
     mc "Umm… Reina..?"
     re "... Listen, I…"
     re "I’m really… not one for conversations. I’m sorry…"
     "She looked down, biting her lip in apparent disappointment."
     mc "Hmmm…"
     mc "Well, that’s fine then."
     re "... huh?"
     mc "We don’t have to talk to learn more about each other, you know. In fact, think it’s funner this way!"
     re "Funner…?"
     mc "Yea! Here, to heck with this talking thing. Why don’t we play a game?"
     re "A game? You have one with you?"
     mc "Anything’s accessible with internet connection!"
     "I whipped out my phone and threw a wink her way."
     re " Pff… hehe, I guess you’re right."
     mc "(Dear lord. A giggle that cute should be illegal--)"
     mc "O-Of course I am!"
     mc "Anyway, ever heard of a game called \"Gad Mab?\""
     "She shook her head."
     mc "It’s a game where you say a set of words out loud, and the other person has to uncover the hidden words within it."
     mc "For example, the phrase \"Ail Huck Each Arm\" has the hidden words \"A lucky charm\" in it. Get it?"
     re "Oh! I hear it!"
     re "Okay, this sounds fun. Let’s play."
     mc "Alright, here’s your first phrase…"
     "I scrolled through a list of Gab Mab phrases on my phone and selected one I found funny."
     mc "Pooh Teal Is Shush"
     re "Pooh teal is shush…."
     re "... Umm…"
     re "Is it… ‘Putty… lease.. us…?"
     mc "Snrk.."
     re "What?"
     mc "That makes no sense, Reina."
     re "I-It does to! What is it then?"
     "I cleared my throat and leaned forward, looking her dead in the eye."
     mc "..."
     mc "Bootylicious."
     re "Pfff-"
     re "Hahaha! And you said my phrase made no sense!"
     mc "Hey, this makes waaaaay more sense than "putty lease us!""
     "She laughed, and the day went on like that, with us chuckling over a silly kid’s game."
     "In the end, she left with a grin on her face."
     "I wished to myself that I could keep making her smile like that."

     md "What, you staying here, [mcname]?"
     mc "Me? Oh, uh.. yea."
     mc "Just got some work to finish up before the end of the day. Nothing major."
     md "Woa, responsible. I like it."
     md "Keep those work ethics up for our project and I just might start respecting you!"
     mc "Haha, sounds like a plan!"
     "They team filed out, and I was left alone."
     "I whipped out my brand new tablet, and started testing out an art program I downloaded the other day."
     mc "(It may not be much, but… Anything is better than nothing.)"
