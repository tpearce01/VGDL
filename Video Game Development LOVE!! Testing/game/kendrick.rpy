    mc "\"I’m hype! I promise that I’m going to produce the heck out of this, I’m ready to roll!\""
    "I put my hands on my hips and puff my chest out proudly, everyone seems to be excited to roll, but Kendrick looks at me with a \"what the hell are you doing\" expression, maybe a bit too enthusiastic?"
    mc "\"B-but remember guys, the most important thing is to h-have fun, hehe.\""

    mc "(Jesus, what's his problem? I didn’t even say anything... maybe this is a comedy bit? Maybe he thinks he’s being funny by being a douchebag?)"
    mc "\"Pshhhh alright dude lmaoooo.\""
    "I look at my fellow club members and motion to Kendrick."
    mc "\"Can you believe this guy? What's up his butt?\""

    kd "A bit?"

    kd "Why would I be joking?"
    mc "\"C-cuz u were being super serious, I-I thought you were trying to scare us.\""
    kd "I never joke. You might think that your game, and probably your life, is a joke, but I’m actually trying to get things done."
    mc "(Dang, he didn’t have to bring my life into this. I guess he’s right though... still he didn’t have to be mean.)"

    "All the invitations had been sent in class, now I just had to wait for everyone to join."
    "Once everyone joined I figured I would get the ball rolling, try to get everyone to introduce themselves, that whole bit."

    mc "\"Alright guys, thank you so much for joining my game crew. I figured it would be fun to introduce ourselves, tell us you’re name, your year, ya major, and fun fact about yourself.\""

    mc "My name is [mcname], I’m a first year, my major is undecided haha, and I was really into dinosaurs when I was a kid, other girls wanted to be princesses and all that, not fam, I wanted to be trex lol."
    kd "Nobody cares. We should have made a slack, people get way to distracted on discord."
    mc "(I decided to post a picture of a sad cat, with the text, \"I’m sorry\")."

    mc "(Does this guy hate me personally or something, did I do something to him in the past that I don’t remember?)"
    mc "\"Are you okay dude?\""
    kd "Yes, I’m just frustrated that every year I get assigned groups led by little kids who don’t know the responsibilities that come with leading a video game development club."
    mc "\"Dude, I don’t think I’ve even done anything to make you think that I’m not capable of leading this team, making this video game has been my dream since I was 8.\""
    kd "Then why haven’t you made it yet?"
    mc "\"I don’t... I don’t know how to make games, hence why I joined this club?\""
    kd "I also wanted to make a game when I was 8, and when I was 9 the game was already done. I know what kind of person you are, you like to daydream and think about all the cool things that you would someday do, but the day never comes. I’m sick of having to be assigned people like you."
    mc "(Man, that cuts deep, he’s right though, I always have these fad dreams that never actually pan out, doing karate, becoming a singer, getting into UCLA.)"
    mc "(Who’s to say that this game won’t just be another thrown away dream in my sea of unfulfilled dreams.)"
    mc "(Damn, I’m tearing up. It's moments like these that make me glad to be online.)"

    mc "(Besides, who does this guy think he is? He doesn’t know me? For all he knows I could be a genius programmer, a fisherman, a ski instructor.)"
    mc "(This guy hasn’t even known me for a whole day and already thinks he has me pinned down?)"
    mc "(JESUS CHRIST I HATE THIS GUY.)"
    mc "(If I don’t change for myself, I’m going to change out of spite, to prove this pretentious freak wrong.)"
    mc "(I’m going to play it cool, I’m happy again that I’m online and can pretend.)"
    mc "\"Dude calm down, get some sleep. It’s true that I don’t have experience making games, but I got pretty good grades and was community service club vice president in high school. I’m sorry for your past experiences, but I can assure, this is not it.\""
