    #SSLH - After Initial Meeting

    mc "(I can't believe I left my phone in the lecture hall...)"
    mc "(Crap, crap, crap...)"
    mc "(Please let it still be there...)"

    "When I entered the lecture hall, I saw a girl drawing on the far wall."
    "It kind of looked like the Audio Officer from the VGDC meeting."

    mc "Excuse me?"
    md "What do you want?"
    mc "Just wondering if you’ve seen a phone around here."
    md "Not really."

    "As Melody was leaving, Alex made his way inside."

    ax "Hey, what’s taking you so long? You okay?"
    mc "Yeah… I just got caught up with talking to Melody."
    ax "The Audio Officer Melody?"
    mc "The one and only!"
    ax "So which one of you did the lovely art on the wall?"
    mc "That? Oh! Uh, not me!"
    ax "I can believe that. You aren’t exactly known for your artistic talent."
    mc "Hey!"
    ax "Relax! I’m joking!"

    LANGSON LIBRARY - Forming Pitch

    md "Hey, bromiga."
    mc "Bromiga?"
    md "It's a combination of 'bro' and 'amiga'. Hence, 'bromiga'."
    mc "Oh, well, hey back, bromiga!"
    md "No... no, it doesn't sound right coming from you."
    mc "Um... okay. Did you need something?"
    md "Just thought I'd come by to see what you're up to."
    mc "I'm working on my pitch."
    md "So you're gonna pitch a game next week?"
    mc "Yeah. I'm just not sure what kind I'm going to do."
    md "Alex isn't going to be part of your team, is he? I've heard he's like, your best friend or something."
    mc "I'm not sure yet."
    md "I'll join your team if you can promise me that he won't join it."
    mc "Uh... do you mind me asking why I couldn't have both of you guys?"
    md "We don't work well together."
    mc "(I felt bad about ditching Alex, but at the same time, to have someone as talented as Melody...")
    mc "Okay, it's a deal."
    md "You're not gonna regret this, (Y/N). Here's my number."

    ax "Hey! What's up?"
    mc "Nothin' much."
    ax "So, you ready to think of a pitch?"
    mc "Um, the thing is... I'm gonna pitch with Melody."

    mc "Yeah. What happened between you two?"
    ax "Why don't you ask her yourself?"
    mc "(Alex left without saying another word.)"

    md "Oh, (Y/N), you're finally here!"
    mc "Hey. What's up?"
    md "I need you to help me with something."
    mc "I'll do what I can!"
    md "That's hella sweet. So, Alex has been trying to get me kicked out of the club forever now."
    md "I need your help in pranking him. To teach him a lesson. What do you say, bromiga?"
    mc "I don't know. Why is he trying to get you kicked out?"
    md "He thinks I'm a "no-good degenerate", that I'm bad for the club's image."

    md "I gotta say... I really wasn't expecting you to say yes."
    mc "He's kind of been a jerk lately."

    CHOICE B - "No, I don't think so..."
    mc "I can't do that. Not to my best friend."
    md "That's weak, bromiga."
    mc "It's not that I don't want to help you. I just don't want to do something nasty to my best friend."
    md "Oh, no, I get it."
    mc "We're still cool with the game thing?"
    md "I guess so. There's nothing I can say to make you change your mind?"
    mc "Not really."
    md "Fine. I'll text you tomorrow."

    CHOICE A

    mc "I don't think what you did was right. But what he did was even worse."
