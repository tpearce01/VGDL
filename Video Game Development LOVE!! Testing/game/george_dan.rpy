    scene bg meeting_2
    mc "Hey that guy looks familiar. I've definitely seen him from somewhere." 
    mc "What the?! He’s that guy that I bumped into earlier today..."
    gd "Hi everyone, welcome to VGDC and to our first meeting of the year! I am your president, Jeorge Dan."
    mc "What?! He’s the president of this club too??"
    gd "This first meeting may not be too exciting, but I promise you that there will be invaluable experiences to gain, many joyous moments to come, and new friends to share those moments with. So with that said, I hope that you will enjoy this journey to the fullest…"
    mc "His tone, his words, the way he speaks… is so familiar. So similar to something I’ve experienced before, yet I can’t recall what it is."
    mc "The way that he is able to captivate the audience..."
    mc "UGGH!! There is a weird, but DEFINITELY familiar feeling about him that that perplexes me that I can’t seem to figure out!!!"
    "(you continue to eye the president)"
    mc "For some odd reason I can't subdue my eyes from gazing at him."
    mc "He’s so enchanting...charming… and the way that we met earlier today… it’s like lo.."
    mc "Damn it! Okay, I gotta snap out of it. I sound so cliche it’s cringe. And I don’t believe in that love at first sight crap either. But yet, this is the first time that I’m really this curious about someone."
    mc "But seriously though, after that first encounter, part of me really wants to know him, wants to know who he is. But what is it about him that makes me so curious?!"
    mc "Oh well, I shouldn’t think too much about it. Too much curiosity is always troublesome."    
    "(something pokes you)"
    mc "HUH?! Something poked me."
    ren "Hey, I didn't expect to see you here!"
    mc "Oh it's Ren! I haven't seen her since high school. She would always treat me like her little sister back then kinda like a bigger sister... always taking care of me and watching over me."
    mc "\"Ren! It's been awhile!\""
    ren "Yeah, it has been awhile. I've missed you kiddo."
    ren "So how do you like it here so far?"
    mc "\"I love it, the weather is nice, and the people are friendly!\""
    ren "Anyway, I see that you are here now, so does that mean you are planning to join VGDC?" 
    mc "\"Yeah I was at their booth earlier and I wanted to check out the first club meeting.\""
    ren "You should definitely join! Take time away from your busywork and enjoy spending time with your biggos here!"
    ren "Are you going to pitch a game idea for the next meeting? I think you should!"
    mc "\"Sadly I don’t think I will. My first year here\"" 
    mc "\"Yeah, I'm considering doing it, but will I have enough time or the ability to run a whole team?\""
    ren "I believe you can do it. You are more than capable! And don't worry, if anything, I’ll personally be here to help you out."
    mc "\"Thanks for the encouragement Ren!\""
    mc "I really do miss talking to Ren."
    mc "At that moment I saw him coming up towards us and Ren started to walk down towards him."
    gd "Hey Ren, long time no see. I need to ask you something, can you come with me?"
    ren "Heya Prez, what's up with the speech? You know this was only a VGDC meeting, not a presidential inauguration... Who are you trying to impress anyway?"
    gd "I'm trying to impress all the beautiful people here of course and also you, Ren."
    ren "Shut up. Am I not pretty enough??."
    #(gd smiles)
    show gd smile
    gd "I’m joking of course. Anyway come with me for a sec."
    ren "You got it..."
    mc "So Ren knows him huh? Here’s my chance to have my curiosity satisfied!! This is perfect!!"
    mc "\"HEY YOU!!\"...wait where did they go?"
    "(a few people in the crowd turns and looks at you)"
    crowd "?..."
    mc "OH SHOOT! WHY IS EVERYONE STARING AT ME?! WAS I THAT LOUD?! THIS IS EMBARRASSING!!!"
    mc "I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!!"
    "(you hastily grab your stuff and start to run out of there)"
    crowd "Who was that?"
    crowd "That was pretty weird.. Who was [they] calling for?"
    crowd "Hey! Maybe [they] was calling for me because [they] thought I was cute!"
    crowd "No fool, you’re ugly."
    crowd "Waah, senpai...you’re so mean."
    crowd "Hey, [they]’s pretty cute though don’t ya think?..."

    mc "That was… the most… EMBARRASSING MOMENT OF MY LIFE!!!"
    mc "That was so embarrassing. Everything felt so embarrassing!!"
    mc "Okay. Okay. Focus... I have to calm down and get work done. Get over it, let the past me worry about what happened."
    mc "Okay… I feel better, time to get work done."
    "(Your stomach growls)"
    mc "Uh…now I’m getting really hungry and I haven’t eaten anything all day too. But the meeting ended so late so I didn’t have time to cook... My life is slowly going down!!!"

    mc "Hello? Dad?"
    dad "Hi my amazing and wonderful child. How was your first few days at school so far?"
    mc "\"I’m hungry…\""
    mc "\"And why do you sound so happy huh?\""
