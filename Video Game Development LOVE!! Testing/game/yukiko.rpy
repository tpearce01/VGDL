    mc "(I decide that programming sounds interesting so I'm going to try to talk to the programming officer.)"
    mc "(I heard at the meeting that there are workshops every week about a variety of topics.)"
    mc "(I check on my phone the date of the next programming workshop.)"
    mc "(I see the programming officer is... Yukiko.)"
    mc "(Ah... she's the girl who forcibly escorted me to the club yesterday.)"
    mc "(She seemed the most approachable out of all the officers, but that might be a problem itself.)"
    mc "(Oh well. If I want to learn how to program, then she would be the best officer to talk to.)"
    mc "What's going to happen to me?"
    mc "(I head over to the game lab to see if she's there.)"

    #knocking sounds hopefully
    #some other officer opens the door drinking soda
    #they ask who they're looking for
    mc "I'm looking for Yukiko, is she here right now?"
    #some other officer says yes, but she might not notice protag right now
    mc "She might not notice me?"
    mc "As in like, kyaa, I hope senpai notices me today?"
    #what?
    #uhh no.. maybe it's better if you went and see it yourself
    mc "(I walk over to the corner where a girl with purple hair is hunched over at a computer, typing away.)"
    mc "Hi Yukiko, do you have some time for a quick chat?"
    yu "..."
    mc "(She remains facing the monitor, unfazed by my presence.)"
    yu "..."
    mc "....."
    yu "......."
    mc "... hello?"
    yu "........."
    mc "(I step forward and wave my hands in front of her.)"
    yu "..........."
    mc "I don't want to do anything that would bother her, so..."
    mc "(I pull up a chair next to her, lean back, and let my mind wander.)"

    mc "(During the hour that elapsed, while glancing at her occasionally in the corner of my eye, I progressed from playing with my phone to reading my textbook to doing homework."
    mc "(After an hour, I give up and decide to watch her.)"
    mc "(She's still calmly typing away at a computer.)"
    mc "(Her face doesn't change except for the occasional furrowing of her brows while waiting for the computer.)"
    mc "(The shine of the monitor reflected in her focused red eyes almost makes it look like she's an android processing lines of code.)"
    mc "(Eventually, she finally shuts down the computer.)"
    mc "(She abruptly stands up, extends her arms upwards, and arches her back forward in a long stretch.)"
    yu "*yawn*"
    mc "Hey."
    yu "Hmm?"
    mc "(Her eyes finally land on me and scan me up and down.)"
    yu "Hey, it's [mcname]!"
    mc "(Contrary to what I expected, her face lights up with the intensity of a thousand suns.)"
    mc "Yeah, I was waiting for you."
    mc "(To be honest, I've never had anyone so earnestly happy to see me before, so I can feel my face begin tinting a light shade of crimson.)"
    mc "(She takes a huge stride into my personal space.)"
    #yukiko kind smile
    yu "What can I do for you today?"
    mc "I, uh..."
    mc "(What did I come here for again..?)"
    yu "Did you need help with programming, perhaps?"
    mc "Oh, right."
    yu "What's your experience level?"
    mc "I'm a complete beginner."
    mc "(I look away rather sheepishly.)"
    yu "Don't worry! Learning is what this club is for."
    yu "Everyone starts somewhere."
    mc "When did you start?"
    #Yukiko nervous
    yu "Uhh..."
    mc "Hmm?"
    yu "When I was... six."
    mc "Oh."
    #Yukiko nervous smile
    yu "Sorry, I didn't mean to get you down."
    yu "Don't worry [mcname], what we do here is for everybody to learn!"
    #Yukiko big smile
    yu "I'll teach you personally!"
    yu "Or if you would prefer something else, there are a lot of tutorials online on how to get started with Python!"
    #Yukiko sparkly eyes ganbatte
    yu "Python is what they teach here in the introductory class and it's the easiest to get started with, and--"
    #fade to black
    #some sound that indicates the time that passed, like the school hour chime
    mc "Ah, I have to get going now."
    mc "My next class is starting soon."
    #Yukiko sad
    yu "Oh..."
    mc "(She looks a bit disappointed, but I don't have a choice.)"
    mc "I'll see you at the programming workshop, okay?"
    mc "(I tell that her gently as if somehow consoling her.)"
    #back to smiley Yukiko
    yu "Yep!"
    mc "(Well, she got better quickly.)"
    yu "See you later!"
    mc "Bye!"
    mc "(I bid farewell to the other club members in the game lab and leave.)"
    #outdoors UCI walking to class
    mc "(Oh boy, I almost spent a whole hour in there with her.)"
    mc "(Rather, I spent most of that time waiting for her.)"
    mc "(She seems a bit strange, but I think she's a good person at heart, with how much she wanted to help me and all.)"
    mc "Well, that's just based on the meager amount of time we had to make first impressions."
    mc "(I hope I can learn more about programming next time.)"

    mc "(Actually managing to call her out here still feels like a dream.)"
    mc "(The cool breeze flowing through the azure night reminds me of time passing by.)"
    mc "(It lulls a me into a reverie of emotional procrastination as I put off processing my feelings of excitement and anxiety.)"
    mc "(The growing sound of rhythmical tapping of boots on concrete breaks me out of my trance.)"
    mc "Hey, Yukiko."
    yu "Hey, MC, you know I've been wondering for the whoooooooooole day what important thing you could possibly have to tell me at the dead of night."
    mc "Oh yeah, sorry about calling you out this late."
    yu "Don't worry, I don't mind."
    yu "I usually stay up working past this hour anyways!"
    mc "You sure work as hard as ever, huh?"
    yu "When I get in the zone, it I just forget that things are moving around me."
    mc "I really like that about you."
    #Yukiko smiles
    yu "Thanks!"
