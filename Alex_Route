SSLH - After Initial Meeting

”I hadn’t talked to Alex since finding out that he was a design officer in the VGDC.”
“I had so many questions.”
“I managed to meet up with him in the food court the next day.”

ax “Bonjour, (y/n)!”
mc “Since when did you speak French?”
ax “Since finding out it’s the language of love, and that chicks really dig bilingual guys.”
mc “(We were just friends, but it always hurt to hear him talk about other girls.)”
mc “Yeah, cool. So, um, why didn’t you tell me that you were in the VGDC?”
ax “You never asked. You’re not mad, are you?”
mc “No, I’m not mad. I just feel like there’s a lot of things I don’t know about you anymore.”
ax “I think I can help with that, if you help me with something.”
mc “What are you talking about?”
ax “So, I went out with the girl last night that I met at the Involvement Fair. It uh, went south pretty quickly.”
mc “How’d you manage to screw it up so fast?”
ax “I guess I have a ‘reputation’ for being a womanizer. And the girl called me out on it.”
mc “Dude… that’s intense.”
ax “Tell me about it. Anyways, we set up a dare.”
mc “What kind of a dare?”
ax “This is actually where you come in. I’ll need you to pretend to be in a fake relationship with me.”
mc “Um…”
ax “And then we’ll break up when she says, “I was wrong about you.” I’ll get my $20, and hopefully the lady.”
mc “That sounds complicated and unnecessary…”
ax “Please, (y/n)… I really like this girl. I gotta clear my name. You’re my best friend, right?”
mc “(I was, at one time…)”
mc “Yeah, that’s right.”
ax “So, can you please help me?”
mc “…okay.”
ax “Since we’re gonna be together a lot more now anyways, why don’t you help me with my pitch for next week, too?”
mc “For the club? You’re gonna pitch a game?”
ax “Yeah! The gameplay is gonna be like, old school Final Fantasy.”
mc “What else?”
ax “Well, that’s all I have so far. Maybe you could help me brainstorm a little more?”
mc “Okay. After class?”
ax “Totally. I’ll text you.”

“Although I thought that his revenge plan was an awful idea, I missed doing stuff with Alex.”
“He had changed. Whether or not for the better, I hadn’t decided yet.”
“But it didn’t really matter. He was my friend, and we were doing stuff together again, like old times.”

SSLH - Pitching Game

”A week passed, and the most important club meeting of the quarter was near - the Pitch Meeting.”
”We had finally decided on a theme for the game - the old west.”
“I’ve never been a huge fan of speaking in front of huge crowds.”
“But with Alex at my side, we could conquer anything.”

ax "Hello everyone! My name is Alex, and this is my friend, (y/n)."
mc "Hi! Uh... so the basic gist of our game is a 2D, turn-based fighting system set in the old west."


ALDRICH PARK - Scouting for Scenes

ax "So, what do you think of the campus so far?"
mc "It's beautiful!"
ax "I was thinking maybe using the part right over there as inspiration for the fights."
mc "I gotta admit though - I never knew you were so into design."
ax "All my life."
