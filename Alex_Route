Scene 1 - Food Court

”I hadn’t talked to Alex since finding out that he was a design officer in the VGDC.”
“I had so many questions.”
“I managed to meet up with him in the food court the next day.”

ax “Bonjour, (y/n)!”
mc “Since when did you speak French?”
ax “Since finding out it’s the language of love, and that chicks really dig bilingual guys.”
mc “(We were just friends, but it always hurt to hear him talk about other girls.)”
mc “Um, okay. So, why didn’t you tell me that you were in the VGDC?”
ax “I dunno. I wanted it to be a surprise.”
mc “It was a crappy surprise."
ax "Sorry I made you feel that way, (Y/N)."
mc "I just feel like there’s a lot of things I don’t know about you anymore.”
ax “I think I can help with that, if you help me with something.”
mc “What are you talking about?”
ax “So, I went out with the girl last night that I met at the Involvement Fair." 
mc "What's her name?"
ax "Naomi. Anyways, it uh, went south pretty quickly.”
mc “How’d you manage to screw it up so fast?”
ax “I guess I have a ‘reputation’ for being a womanizer. And Naomi called me out on it.”
mc “Dude… that sucks.”
ax “Tell me about it. Anyways, this is where you come in.”
mc “What are you gonna make me do?”
ax “I’ll need you to pretend to be in a fake relationship with me.”
mc “Um…”
ax "Please say you'll help me, (Y/N)."

Diverges into 2 options:
[Pos. Option] "Yes"
mc "Okay, but how does it benefit me?"
ax "You'll get the satisfaction of helping your best friend in his time of need."
mc "That's it?"
ax "I'll also help you with a pitch for the meeting next week."
mc "(I did want to pitch something next week...)"
mc "(And if I had the help of one of the official officers, I was sure to get accepted.)"
mc "All right. As long as your plan doesn't involve anything super awful."
ax “Nah! I’ll text you later about it.”

[Neg. Option] "No"
mc "I'm not comfortable with doing something like that."
ax "So you're gonna abandon your friend in his time of need?"
mc "I'm not 'abandoning' you..."
ax "Look, help me with this, and I'll help you with your pitch for next week."
mc "How'd you know that I wanted to pitch...?"
ax "Just a good guess."
mc "(I did want to pitch something next week...)"
mc "(And if I had the help of one of the official officers, I was sure to get accepted.)"
mc "Fine. I'll help, but I'm still not comfortable with all of this."
ax "It won't be for very long, I promise. I'll text you later about it."

“Although I thought that his revenge plan was an awful idea, I missed doing stuff with Alex.”
“He had changed. Whether or not for the better, I hadn’t decided yet.”
“But it didn’t really matter. He was my friend, and we were doing stuff together again, like old times.”

Scene 2 - Starbucks Student Center

“We met up the next day to discuss the pitch.”

ax "Okay, so what’s our plan?”
mc "I was thinking of a dating sim, but with cats."
ax "So kind of like Hatoful Boyfriend?"
mc "Yeah! But with cats."
ax “Sounds weird, but its got cats, so…”

"Before Alex could continue, a girl in a demin jacket walked up to our table."

nm "Alex."
ax "Naomi."
nm “Who’s this?”
mc "My name is (Y/N)."
nm “How do you two know each other?"
mc “We’ve known each other since grade school."
nm "Oh, is that so? How cute."
ax "Can you please leave, Naomi?"

"A shiver went down my spine as Naomi glared down at me, her arms crossed."

nm “Don’t come back to me and say I didn’t tell you so.”
mc "How can I? You haven't told me anything."
nm "I don't think you realize how popular your little boytoy here is around the campus."
ax "What can I say? I get around."
nm "He's what you might call a 'serial dater'."
mc "I've never heard of that term before. Since when has Alex dated cereal?"
nm "Ugh. No, 'serial' dater. He... he dates many women but never forms a deep bond or relationship with them."
mc "Well, like I said, I've known him for a long time. Whatever kind of guy he is, I'm okay with it."
nm "Do you love him?"

"Alex looked at me expectantly."

mc "Uh... well, as a friend I do. If it's more, then... then I guess we'll find out."
nm "Hm. Anyways, my point was that people have been talking. Like, a lot of people. Almost everybody. Watch yourself."
ax "Okay, seriously, Naomi - leave. Now."
nm "You're digging yourself into a deep hole, (Y/N). Be wary of how far that hole goes. You may find yourself unable to get out."

"Naomi left, and I sat there baffled."

mc "Everyone's talking about it?"
ax "Don't worry. She's just trying to psyche you out."
mc "If you say so."
ax "I'm serious. Why are you even worrying about it now?"
mc "Because I..."
mc "(Because suddenly my feelings for you extend beyond the 'just friends' amount.)"
mc "You know what? Nevermind."
ax "Okay. Back to the game pitch. So, it's Hatoful Boyfriend with cats. What else?"
mc "What... what do you mean, what else?"
ax "How long do you want to work on it? Just for a quarter? Or longer?"
mc "Uh... I dunno. Ask me another question."
ax "Besides me, did you have anyone else you wanted to have join the group?"
mc "Well, no. You're the only person I really know."
ax "All right. What position did you want to be?"
mc "The... the top position?"
ax "What?"
mc "I only know of two positions. Top and bottom."
ax "Oh, god, no, not like... not "bed" position. Did you wanna be a writer, or a producer, or an artist, or-"
mc "Designer. I want to be a designer."
ax "I assumed that I would be the designer, but-"
mc "No, no. I guess I meant junior designer. Assistant designer. You would, of course, be the main designer."
ax "Are you actually interested in becoming a designer, or are you just trying to find an excuse to get closer to me?"
mc "It could be a little of both."
ax "If I didn't know better, I'd say that you were flirting with me."
mc "You're reading too much into it. I want more coffee."
ax "Then, I will go grab you more coffee, dear."

"The word 'dear' made my stomach turn. He said it so... so casually."
"Was this really just a revenge scheme, or was it quickly turning into something more?"

Scene 3 - Food Court

"The conversation with Naomi yesterday made me realize that I didn't really know a lot about the "new" Alex."
"Growing up, he was kind of a quiet guy. He was always super friendly, though."
"And also, he was into sports, not art."
"So, how did he become the Design leader of a Video Game Design Club?"

mc "I had no idea you were into the whole design thing."
ax "Sure am! It's really pretty cool.”
mc “What exactly do you do?”
ax “I do the aesthetics. Making sure it looks good and it’s all zen and lookin’ good. Things like that.”
mc “You were always into football. It’s so weird to think that you’re like, artsy now.”
ax “It was soccer, and it’s not an absurd idea.”
mc “But a self-proclaimed hardcore jock boy turning into a sensitive artist?”
ax “I went to high school, broadened my horizons a little, and decided that I really enjoyed doing the whole design thing.”
mc “Is it something you just stumbled onto, or…?”
ax “I was required to take a couple of electives, so I did a graphic design course one year. It was fun.”
mc “Huh.”
ax “What? Not exciting enough for you?”
mc “No, I’m just trying to figure out why, still.”
ax “There were a lot of cute chicks in the class that I wanted to impress. I worked hard, got good, and now here I am.”
mc “That makes a lot more sense."
ax “I think that you could be a really great designer too.”
mc “That sounds like a lie.”
ax “Not at all! You’ve got a sharp eye for detail, and you stand by your convictions.”
mc “Um… thank you?”
ax "Didn't you want to do design on our club project anyways?"
mc "Well, yeah."
ax “See? Ugh, it’s five to three. We should probably get to class.”

“Alex had changed so much… but at the same time, he hadn’t changed at all.”

Scene 4 - SSLH

”A week passed, and the most important club meeting of the quarter was near - the Pitch Meeting.”
”We had finally decided on a theme for the game - the old west.”
“I’ve never been a huge fan of speaking in front of huge crowds.”
“But with Alex at my side, we could conquer anything.”

ax "Hello everyone! My name is Alex, and this is my friend, (y/n)."
mc "Hi! Uh... so the basic gist of our game is that it's a dating simulator about cats."
ax "Think 'Hatoful Boyfriend'."

“As we went to sit back down, my heart was racing.”
“People didn’t seem thrilled about the idea. It looked like there were a lot more dog lovers than cat lovers.”
“But with Alex, I hoped that maybe they’d be more willing to sign on.”

Scene 5 - Aldrich Park

ax "What do you think of the campus so far? It's not quite UCLA, but..."
mc "Well, I think it's really, really green."
ax "Is... is that good?"
mc "Nature is good. And I like how like, you can get most places by going in a circle."
ax "Oh, Ring Road?"
mc "Yeah! Ring Road is super convenient."
ax "Speaking of circles... it's funny."
mc "What is?"
ax "You remember how we 'went out' in Junior High for a week?"
mc "Oh yeah! That was crazy. Why did we break up again?"
ax "Because I wasn't Legolas."
mc "Right. Uh, why is that funny?"

Scene 6 - Food Court

ax "Thanks for meeting me here."
mc "Of course. What do you need?"
ax "I've got a confession to make."

"Alex had become uncharacteristically quiet."

mc "What happened? Is it about Naomi?"
ax "Yes. No. Nothing. Nothing bad."
mc "Whatever it is, it's not going to change our relationship."
ax "I wouldn't be so sure about that."
mc "Well, are you going to tell me? Or keep stringing me along?"
ax "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
ax "..."
ax "I don't want to pretend anymore."
mc "Pretend what?"
ax "This. Us. You and me. (Y/N), I've liked you for so long. Since we were kids."
mc "Are you serious?"
ax "100%."
mc "I... don't know what to say..."
ax "Say that we can stop pretending. Say that you feel the same way about me. I love you, (Y/N)."

CHOICE A - "I love you!"
mc "I love you too, Alex. Let's... let's stop pretending."
ax "Phew... that was hard..."
mc “Just… what about Naomi?"
ax “Naomi is nice, but she’s not you. Not by a longshot.”
mc “So is that… that’s it?”
ax “Besides the obligatory social media update spam, yeah. I guess that’s it.”
mc “I don’t feel any different.”
ax “Me neither. I think we just need time to let it sink in.”

CHOICE B - "Wait a second..."
mc "I'm still not completely convinced, Alex."
ax "Y-yeah... okay. Y'know, I was just kidding."
mc "It sure didn't look like it."
ax "Nah. You and me, officially a couple? If we were going to do that, we would have done it forever ago."
mc "Yeah, I guess. Are you okay?”
ax “Sure! Why wouldn’t I be okay?”
mc “Again, you just seemed to take it super personally just then.”
ax “Nah, nah, we’re cool. We’re good. Let’s finish eating.”


CHOICE A
[scene 1]
mc “You okay?”
ax “Yeah, just thinking. Wow, you and me, together. This feels... good."

[scene 2]
"Weeks passed, and we were so happy."
"We did everything together. Just like old time."
"The only difference was that we were past the friend stage. We were in love."



[scene 3]
"Our game was set to be completed in the following week."
"Alex had stopped returning my texts. He didn't want to meet up for lunch..."
"And then I found out the truth."

mc “Alex? I thought I’d find you here.”
ax “Oh. (Y/N). What are you doing here?”
mc “You’re my boyfriend, and you’re basically acting like I don’t exist.”
ax “What? Nah.”
mc “I’ve texted you three times since this morning. A couple people dropped out, and the game needs to be finished by next week.”
ax “Sorry. I’ve been distracted.”
mc “Clearly. But that doesn’t give you the right to ignore me.”
ax “I wasn’t ignoring you.”
mc "You went back to Denim Jacket?"
ax "Her name is Naomi."
mc "I don't care WHAT her name is. How could you do this to me?"
ax "Everyone keeps on telling me how much I've changed. And maybe I have."
ax "But so have you. It feels like you're leaching off me.”

Diverges into 2 options:
[Pos. Option] “You think I’ve been leaching off you?”
mc "Okay, but how does it benefit me?"
ax "You'll get the satisfaction of helping your best friend in his time of need."
mc "That's it?"
ax "I'll also help you with a pitch for the meeting next week."
mc "(I did want to pitch something next week...)"
mc "(And if I had the help of one of the official officers, I was sure to get accepted.)"
mc "All right. As long as your plan doesn't involve anything super awful."
ax “Nah! I’ll text you later about it.”

[Neg. Option] "What are you talking about!?"
mc “Leaching? I’m leaching off you? What does that even mean?”
ax “You used to be so independent, never took no for an answer.”

ENDING
[end - pos]
mc “You should have told me if you had such a problem with the way I was acting.”
ax “What was I supposed to say? Stop being so annoying?”
mc “We could have just gone back to being friends.”
ax “So why don’t we?”
mc “Because you ruined it. You ruined everything.”
ax “I ruined everything? I wasn’t the clingy, needy one.”
mc “You’re awful.”
ax “We’re both kind of awful. Look, I’m sorry. I don’t want to fight. Go back to being friends?”
mc “It’s gonna take some time.”
ax “Well, sure. Of course. But we’ve got all the time in the world.”
mc “Yeah. You’re right. Let’s start our friendship over.”
ax “The best way to do that is by grabbing coffee.”
mc “Sounds great.”

“Looking back, the last few weeks had been a trainwreck.”
“I lost the love of my life.”
“I lost the best friendship I’d ever had.”
“Our cat dating sim never ended up getting finished.”
“But I was still standing, and I had the chance to win my best friend back.”
“Things could only go up from here.”

[end - neg]
mc "You're really going to pin all of this on me?"
ax "We didn't finish the game because of YOU."
mc "How is it my fault!?"
ax "Your constant nagging, dragging me to places instead of to the meetings so we could finish things."
mc "That's what couples do!"
ax "If you love someone, then you're not going to keep them from doing what they want to do.”
mc “I thought this was what you wanted to do!”
ax “I changed my mind. I’m leaving.”
mc "Alex! Don't leave, please! I love you!"
ax "Yeah, and I thought I loved you too."

“Looking back, the last few weeks had been a trainwreck.”
“I lost the love of my life.”
“I lost the best friendship I’d ever had.”
“Our cat dating sim never ended up getting finished.”
“I ended up all alone, and it hurt.”
“I tried to find a silver lining in the whole situation, but there wasn’t one.”
“There was nothing I could do. It was the death of the best friendship I’d ever had.”

CHOICE B
[scene 1]
ax "Look, about the other day..."
mc "Forget about it. Let's just work on our game, okay?"
ax “No, I don’t want to forget about it. I want to talk about it.”
mc “What’s there to talk about?”
ax “I… I know I said I was kidding when I said everything, but a small part of me wasn’t.”
mc “I kind of figured. You were always a bad liar.”

[scene 2]
"Our game was set to be completed in the following week."
"One of the writers in our group had flaked out early on."
"We were scrambling to get everything done on time."

[scene 3]
ax "Wow, our game turned out great!"
mc "Well, that's to be expected with the two best designers on campus."
ax "True. True."
mc "

[end]
ax "Thanks for everything, (Y/N)."
mc "It's what friends do!"
ax "Then I'm super lucky to have a friend like you.”
mc “Do you ever think of like, what could have been?”
ax ”I’m not sure what you mean.”
mc “What if I had said that I loved you too a few weeks ago?”
ax “I dunno.”
mc “Do you think things could have worked out between us?”
ax “Romantically? Probably. But there’s also the other option, where it ends up badly, with both of us pissed and throwing shoes at each other.”
mc “I’d like to think that I’d throw slippers, because at least they’re soft.”
ax “Shoes, slippers - doesn’t mater. This way was better. No negative outcomes come out of a friendship built on respect.”
mc “Yeah, that’s true.”
ax “Anyways, enough with the depressing alternate universe theories. We finished a game! We need to celebrate!”
mc “What are you thinking?”
ax “Laser tag?”
mc “Yes. Laser tag.”
