SSLH - After Initial Meeting

“It didn’t feel right that one of my best friends was keeping secrets from me."
“So, I decided to confront Alex about it.”

ax “Bonjour, (y/n)!”
mc “Since when did you speak French?”
ax “It’s the language of love, mon amie.” 
mc “That didn't answer my question, but forget about it. Why you didn’t tell me your club was the VGDC!?”
ax “I was going to get to it, but… the girl in the Demin jacket, you know.”
mc “Did you ever get her number?”
ax “I did! We went on a date last night. It went south pretty quickly. She’s pretty pissed at me.”
mc “That’s too bad. Sorry, dude.”
ax “Yeah, about that. I wanted to ask you a couple things.”
mc “Sure, what is it?”
ax “One: I’m gonna pitch a game next week, and I want you to be a part of my team.”
mc “Yeah, sounds fun! Just don’t make me do all the work like every other group project we've done.”
ax “Haha! I promise I won’t."
mc "Do you have any plans for it yet?"
ax "I was thinking like, a simple Final Fantasy type game, but... well, actually, that's all I have so far."
mc "That's so specific. What's the other thing you wanted to ask?"
ax "Two: I need your help with getting back at the girl in the Demin jacket.”
mc "(What the hell, Alex!?)"
mc "I... what do you mean?"
ax "It's nothing evil. Just... pretend to go out with me for a couple weeks. I want to make her jealous."
mc "How would us pretending to go out do anything?"
ax "Like I said, I want to make her jealous. I want her to see that she could have had it all."
mc "I, um, still don't quite understand. I'll help out, though."
ax "Great! You're the best (y/n)! See you at class later?"
mc "Y-yeah."

“I wasn’t completely on board with helping Alex and his little scheme of getting back at the girl.”
“And I wasn’t too sure about doing the game thing with him either, honestly.”
“But, I loved the idea of doing things with my best friend again.”
“And that trumped every ounce of doubt I had.”
