SSLH - After Initial Meeting

“It didn’t feel right that one of my best friends was keeping secrets from me."
“So, I decided to confront Alex about it.”

ax “Bonjour, (y/n)!”
mc “Since when did you speak French?”
ax “It’s the language of love, mon amie.” 
mc “Okay… forget I said anything. What I really want to know is why you didn’t tell me your club was the VGDC!”
ax “I was going to get to it, but… the girl in the Demin jacket.”
mc “Did you ever get her number?”
ax “I did! We went on one date. It went south pretty quickly. She’s pretty pissed at me.”
mc “That’s too bad. Sorry, dude.”
ax “Yeah, about that. I wanted to ask you a couple things.”
mc “Throw ‘em at me.”
ax “One: I’m gonna pitch a game next week, and I want you to be a part of my team.”
ax “Can we do a group project again, just like old times?”
mc “Yeah, sure. Just don’t make me do all the work like old times.”
ax “Haha! I promise I won’t. And number two: I need your help with getting back at the girl in the Demin jacket.”

“I wasn’t completely on board with helping Alex and his little scheme of getting back at the girl.”
“And I wasn’t too sure about doing the game thing either. I didn’t know the first thing about being in a group in the club.”
“But, I loved the idea of doing things with my best friend again.”
“And that trumped every ounce of doubt I had.”
