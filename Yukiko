# INTRO SCENE
label yu_intro:
    #idk location
    mc "(I decide that programming sounds interesting so I'm going to try to talk to the programming officer.)"
    mc "(I heard at the meeting that there are workshops every week about a variety of topics.)"
    mc "(I check on my phone the date of the next programming workshop.)"
    mc "(I see the programming officer is... Yukiko.)"
    mc "(Ah... she's the girl who forcibly escorted me to the club yesterday.)"
    mc "(She seemed the most approachable out of all the officers, but that might be a problem itself.)"
    mc "(Oh well. If I want to learn how to program, then she would be the best officer to talk to.)"
    mc "What's going to happen to me?"
    mc "(I head over to the game lab to see if she's there.)"

#END INTRO SCENE

label yu_scene1:
    #game lab
    mc "(I notice a large sign indicating that food and drink are forbidden.)"
    #knocking sounds hopefully
    #some other officer opens the door drinking soda
    #they ask who they're looking for
    mc "I'm looking for Yukiko, is she here right now?"
    #some other officer says yes, but she might not notice protag right now
    mc "She might not notice me?"
    mc "As in like, kyaa, I hope senpai notices me today?"
    #what?
    #uhh no.. maybe it's better if you went and see it yourself
    mc "(I walk over to the corner where a girl with purple hair is hunched over at a computer, typing away.)"
    mc "Hi Yukiko, do you have some time for a quick chat?"
    yu "..."
    mc "(She remains facing the monitor, unfazed by my presence.)"
    yu "..."
    mc "....."
    yu "......."
    mc "... hello?"
    yu "........."
    mc "(I step forward and wave my hands in front of her.)"
    yu "..........."
    mc "I don't want to do anything that would bother her, so..."
    #another officer tells protag that they have to break her line of sight with the monitor for at least 5 seconds
    mc "Maybe I'll just come back another time."
    mc "I proceed to turn around and leave, but I forget that I moved closer to her than I thought to wave my hands in front of Yukiko's face."
    mc "I trip on the leg of her chair, bringing her toppling down onto me."
    mc "(The loud crashing noise steals the attention of everyone in the game lab."
    #Yukiko's sprite zoomed right in front of your grill
    mc "(Her unfocused red eyes take a bit to adjust to the troublesome scene surrounding her.)"
    mc "(Amidst everyone's stares, I manage to force out a single word.")
    mc "Hey."
    mc "(Contrary to what I expected, her face lights up with the intensity of a million suns and she moves her body closer to mines.)"
    #we all know her huge rack is pressing on you at this point but this is a pg-13 game so im just gonna ignore that
    yu "Hey, it's [mcname]!"

#Confession Scene
label yu_scene?:
    #probably a scene of UTC at night
    mc "(Actually managing to call her out here still feels like a dream.)"
    mc "(The cool breeze flowing through the azure night reminds me of time passing by.)"
    mc "(It lulls a me into a reverie of emotional procrastination as I put off processing my feelings of excitement and anxiety.)"
    mc "(The growing sound of rhythmical tapping of boots on concrete breaks me out of my trance.)"
    mc "Hey, Yukiko."
    yu "Hey, MC, you know I've been wondering for the whoooooooooole day what important thing you could possibly have to tell me at the dead of night."
    mc "Oh yeah, sorry about calling you out this late."
    yu "Don't worry, I don't mind."
    yu "I usually stay up working past this hour anyways!"
    mc "You sure work as hard as ever, huh?"
    yu "When I get in the zone, it I just forget that things are moving around me."
    mc "I really like that about you."
    #Yukiko smiles
    yu "Thanks!"
    #Yukiko tries to make small talk
    mc "U-um, let's get to what I came out here to talk to you about!"
    yu "Right, right; sorry for sidetracking."
    mc "Well... you see..."
    yu "Yes?"
