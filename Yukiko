## YUKIKO ROUTE ##

# INTRO SCENE
    #aldrich park or something
    "I walk out of my boring lecture into the fair weather and stifle a yawn."
    mc "(I know I shouldn't, but I stayed up last night again.)"
    "I pull out my phone while walking slowly and aimlessly on the park's paths."
    mc "(Yesterday's club meeting was interesting.)"
    mc "(Programming sounds like my cup of tea, so I'm going to try to talk to the programming officer.)"
    "The programming officer's name is... Yukiko?"
    mc "(Ah... she's the girl who forcibly escorted me to the club yesterday.)"
    mc "(She seems the most approachable out of all the officers, but that might be a problem itself.)"
    mc "(Oh well. If I want to learn how to program, then she would be the best officer to talk to.)"
    "I clutch my phone hopefully and shuffle weakly over to the game lab."
    #outside of game lab
    "There's a large sign on the door indicating that food and drink are forbidden."
    #knocking sounds
    #some other officer opens the door drinking soda
    mc "Hi, is the programming officer here right now?"
    re "Sorry, Yukiko isn't here right now..."
    mc "Oh, that's okay."
    mc "I'll come back later."
    #disappear reina!
    "I take my leave while shutting the door at the same time."
    mc ("I actually feel like crashing on the nearest soft surface right now.")
    "I attempt to drag myself back home..."
    #switch to aldrich park
    "... and I end up collapsed in the park on the grass."
    mc "(I can't do it anymore...)"
    mc "(I'll rest my eyes... just for a little...)"
    "My vision fills with black as sleep overtakes me."
    #uh, wait 5 seconds or something?
    mc "Ngh...........nnn."
    mc "Just five more minutes..."
    "I allow my eyes to peek open ever so slightly."
    "An unpleasant orange immediately stains my vision as I realize I am facing the sunset."
    "I turn over onto my other side away from the light."
    "I prepare to shut my eyes to go back to sleep until I notice a faint purple through my eyelashes."
    "Opening my eyes further reveals a rather unexpected scene before me."
    mc "Whoa!"
    "I bolt upwards to a sitting position in surprise."
    "Right in front of me is a girl sleeping peacefully on her back."
    "Her long, straight purple hair is slightly astray with strands wavering in the wind."
    mc "(Actually, this wind is getting really strong.)"
    #a gust of wind?!
    "*SNAP!*"
    "A relatively large branch suddenly falls towards her."
    mc "Get out of the way!"
    "She began to stir."
    "Without thinking, I dash into a standing position with her between and below my legs with my back towards the falling branch's trajectory."
    #close up of Yukiko's calm sprite
    "Her crimson eyes flicker for a moment before dilating and meeting mines, seemingly lasting forever due to the adrenaline."
    "As if she understood just by our brief exchange of gazes, her sleepy face snaps to one of urgency as she suddenly jumped up and tackled me."
    #thud
    mc "OOHOUGH!"
    "I wasn't prepared for a hit by a surprising amount of force from the front, so I toppled backwards onto the grass, disheveled but out of harm's way."
    "The branch hits the ground with a loud crack."
    "We sit there in surreal silence for a few moments before the girl sitting on top of me finally speaks."
    #nervous
    yu "Gosh, what are you doing?"
    yu "That branch almost hit you!"
    "Her girly, singsong voice comes out light but worried."
    mc "Wait, what?!"
    mc "That's my line!"
    mc "A branch fell towards you while you were sleeping and I was trying to block it."
    #calm
    yu "Hmm, that's what happened?"
    mc "Yes, it did..."
    mc "(Why did I even try?)"
    #smile
    yu "C'mon, cheer up!"
    yu "Sorry, I was just teasing you."
    "I put my hand on my forehead in exasperation and suddenly wince in pain."
    #calm
    yu "Oh, you have a cut on your hand."
    "She fumbles around in her pocket for a moment before pulling out two bandaids."
    #happy
    yu "which one would you like?"
    mc "Uhh.."
    yu "Bzzt, time's up; you get both!"
    #calm
    "Her face resets into one of pure concentration."
    yu "Oh wait, I should probably clean this first."
    "She pulls out a handkerchief and gently wipes the blood and dirt from my injury."
    yu "I'm sure I should have put some antiseptic on first, but we don't have that right now..."
    "She tears open a bandaid and carefully places it over my cut, her hands working with an unexpected speed and precision."
    mc "You seem like you're used to this."
    yu "..."
    "She repeats the process except with another bandaid, forming a cross pattern on the back of my hand."
    #happy
    "Admiring her work, she smiles to herself in satisfaction while still sitting on me."
    #calm
    mc "Could you move of--"
    yu "Sorry, did you say something earlier?"
    mc "Oh, uh, you seem like you're used to this."
    #nervous
    yu "Ah, I tend to get little cuts and bruises a lot."
    yu "Sometimes, when I'm walking around and thinking about something, I bump into a whole lot of stuff!"
    mc "Is that why you carry bandaids on you?"
    #happy
    yu "Yep!"
    #calm
    yu "Did they help you feel better?"
    mc "Sure, but why two?"
    yu "It's cooler that way."
    yu "Don't you think it's like some cool symbol thingy on your hand?"
    #happy
    yu "Everyone knows crosses are cooler than straight lines."
    yu "Like, paths having crossed once is more charming than being parallel lines who are always besides each other but will never touch?"
    mc "But couldn't you just use one bandaid though?"
    mc "(God, I'm letting myself get caught up in this girl's pace.)"
    yu "But one bandaid by itself will get lonely."
    #calm
    "The girl directs her eyes upwards and rests an index finger on her chin, as if thinking."
    "I expect another eccentric line out of her but she quickly subverts my expectations again."
    yu "Hey, aren't you [mcname]?!"
    #happy
    "Contrary to what I expected, her face lights up with the intensity of a thousand suns."
    mc "I was looking for you."
    mc "(To be honest, I've never had anyone so earnestly happy to see me before.)"
    mc "(That, and I'm beginning to become more conscious of her weight on me.)"
    "I can feel my face begin tinting a light shade of crimson."
    "She leans in a bit closer despite already sitting on me."
    yu "What can I do for you today?"
    mc "You can get off me first."
    #nervous
    yu "Oh, sorry."
    "She whispers that rather quietly."
    mc "(That was surprisingly meek of her.)"
    #remove her sprite
    "We dust the dirt and plant matter off ourselves."
    #bring her sprite back at a reasonable distance and calm
    mc "Why were you napping next to me?"
    yu "Well, I walked to the game lab and Reina described a male student who was looking for me."
    mc "(I wonder what Reina said about me...)"
    yu "I remembered I abduct -- I mean persuaded a guy matching the description yesterday to join the club."
    #change to happy sprite in the middle of the line? "I mean persuaded"
    mc "(No, you totally kidnapped me.)"
    yu "I was walking back and noticed you napping on the grass."
    yu "You looked so peaceful, I didn't want to wake you."
    #calm
    yu "I sat down waited but the weather was so nice and the wind was so cool."
    yu "The birds were chirping, and the rays of the sun were so warm!"
    mc "Don't worry, I understand. I would have napped too."
    #happy
    yu "Riiiiiight?"
    mc "Now why was I looking for you again?"
    yu "Programming?"
    yu "It's the only thing I do."
    mc "Oh, right, programming!"
    #calm
    yu "What's your experience level?"
    mc "I'm a complete beginner."
    "I look away rather sheepishly."
    #happy
    yu "Don't worry! Learning is what this club is for."
    yu "Everyone starts somewhere."
    mc "When did you start?"
    #fear
    yu "Uhh..."
    mc "Hmm?"
    yu "When I was... six."
    mc "Oh."
    yu "Sorry, I didn't mean to get you down."
    yu "Don't worry [mcname], what we do here is for everybody to learn!"
    #happy
    yu "I'll teach you personally!"
    yu "Or if you would prefer something else, there are a lot of tutorials online on how to get started with Python!"
    yu "Python is what they teach here in the introductory class and it's the easiest to get started with, and--"
    "The school bell chimes."
    mc "Oh crap, I'm gonna be late for my evening lab!"
    #sad
    yu "Oh..."
    "She looks a bit disappointed, but I don't have a choice."
    mc "I'll see you at the programming workshop, okay?"
    mc "(I tell that her gently as if somehow consoling her.)"
    #happy
    yu "Yep!"
    mc "(Well, she got better quickly.)"
    yu "See you later!"
    mc "Bye!"
    yu "By the way, thanks for protecting me!"
    #make her sprite disappear
    "She scurries off before I could say anything else."
    "I turn around and walk away with what must have been a smile on my face."
    "It then occurs to me that I forgot to ask her when the workshop will be."

#end of intro

#scene1 programming workshop
    "A week later in the game lab..."
    #fade into game lab
    #yukiko nervous
    yu "A-and so, for testing code, they say that ninety percent of the work goes into the last ten percent of software, so it's like ten times the effort for a tenth of the fun..."
    "She says all this with strange inflections in her tone of voice."
    yu "(She's so nervous..)"
    "Yukiko proceeds to drop all her notes onto the floor."
    yu "Ahh! I'm so sorry everyone!"
    mc "(Wow, she's a mess right now.)"
    mc "(I don't know much about programming to be able to say anything to help her out.)"
    "A few other students and I stand up to help her gather her dropped papers."
    #fade to black short timeskip
    "The rest of the meeting went shakily but steadily."
    "Much to Yukiko's dismay, a lot of students had questions for her afterwards."
    "I waited until everyone dispersed to approach her."
    #sad yukiko sprite going downwards
    yu "Uuuu..."
    "She slumps down onto a desk in the corner."
    mc "Hey, Yukiko."
    "From the top of the desk, she directs a cute upward gaze against me as if projecting a telepathic barrier with her eyes to prevent any further inquiries."
    "I almost felt like a criminal walking up to her."
    mc "That must have been stressful."
    "Her eyes give up on arresting me and face forward into empty space."
    yu "I wish it wasn't."
    mc "What do you mean?"
    yu "I always get like this with large groups."
    yu "The way the saying goes is to picture everyone in their underwear, but really, how would that help?"
    yu "If anything, I would feel like I'm the one who's out of place being the only one wearing clothes."
    "Yukiko sighs."
    yu "Two is great, three's a party, but any more than that.. I.."
    mc "Get overwhelmed?"
    "She gives a slight nod with her head as much as being on a flat surface would allow."
    mc "You were so talkative when you met me though."
    #nervous
    yu "I just woke up from a nap so I was refreshed and the adrenaline of almost being hit by a branch and you seemed like a good person and--"
    "I might be imagining it, but it looks like her eyes are spinning in circles from the speed at which she is looking around."
    mc "Thanks. It wasn't what I expected when I took a nap in the park, but I had fun talking to you."
    #calm
    "Her eyes lock onto me again."
    yu "Really?"
    "She utters that word timidly."
    mc "I mean it. I mean, you seem like a person who would have a lot of friends."
    "As the words left my mouth, I immediately regret speaking before thinking."
    #sad
    "My fears are justified as her hopeful expression unravels."
    yu "That's not true, though."
    yu "I've talked to a lot of people here, but I don't have many people I can call a friend."
    yu "At this school, maybe only Reina."
    mc "Maybe?"
    #knocking sounds
    "As if we spoke of the devil, Reina suddenly enters the game lab."
    #reina calm sprite entering from the side
    "As she scanned the room for a place to sit, Reina's expression changes from a slight smile upon spotting Yukiko to a slight frown upon seeing me."
    re "Yuki... is he bothering you?"
    "I involuntarily flinch at the timid girl's sharp words."
    mc "(Now that I think about it, standing over and talking down to Yukiko like this doesn't exactly look very friendly.)"
    mc "Oh sorry, I was just.."
    "Yukiko stands up and suddenly glomps Reina."
    #move a happy Yukiko up and towards Reina surprised
    re "Kyah!"
    yu "Don't worry Reina. He was just comforting me after my big workshop flop."
    #Reina blush and wriggling a bit
    "Reina wriggles around a bit like a captured animal, but quickly lets out a sigh of resignation to her fate."
    #Reina calm
    re "Yuki, you know the only reason they always have questions is because they aren't getting what you're saying during your presentation."
    #Yukiko sad
    yu "Uuuu..."
    #Reina calm
    re "That being said... if you have any worries... you can just come to me."
    #Yukiko surprised
    "Yukiko makes a surprised face but quickly turns into sunshines and rainbows in response."
    #Yukiko happy
    yu "Reina!"
    "She holds onto Reina even tighter."
    re "Agh.. I'm choking.."
    "I couldn't help but fail at surpressing a laugh at such a heartwarming scene."
    "Reina seems to be uncomfortable but I couldn't shake the feeling that she looks slightly happy."
    re "Well? What's on your mind?"
    yu "I... don't have many friends here."
    re "And that bothers you, right?"
    yu "Yeah."
    "Reina shrinks down a bit deeper into Yukiko's embrace."
    re "I know... I'm the worst person you could ask for advice about this but..."
    re "I see you talking to a lot of people all the time."
    #Yukiko sad
    yu "Right?"
    re "Wait.. I'm not finished."
    re "At least from my perspective... when you talk to them..."
    re "It looks like you're not being yourself."
    #Yukiko surprised
    yu "Really?"
    mc "(I wonder if the Yukiko who bandaged me is the same as the Yukiko sitting in front of me right now.)"
    re "So what you can do is..."
    re "At least for me.. I don't want many friends."
    re "But if you're not satisfied with your amount of friends, you should go out and talk to people."
    #Yukiko calm
    re "Not like talking, but... connecting."
    yu "You mean like speaking what's on my mind, or..?"
    re "Not exactly that..."
    mc "I've kind of read a book about this before."
    mc "Maybe you have to stop being polite and start being real?"
    mc "Not everyone will like you so you have to show people who you really are so they can decide to like you or not?"
    "They both stare at me."
    mc "Oh sorry, that sounds silly, doesn't it?"
    yu "No, it doesn't."
    re "If you backpedal now... you would be a hypocrite."
    yu "Since [mcname] would be denying what he just said?"
    mc "(Ack, they got me there!)"
    mc "I was just mentioning something I read; it doesn't mean I necessarily believe in it."
    yu "True..."
    mc "But then again, knowing about the books someone reads probably tells a lot about them..."
    #fade to black
    "We continue to discuss how to make friends for a good hour."
    #back to the park yet again
    #Yukiko happy very close to Reina calm
    "Even while walking back in the park, Yukiko clings to Reina."
    re "This is where I'm turning... so..."
    #yeah uh try your best to show the following?
    "Reina effortlessly slips out under Yukiko's arms by simply bending her knees and kneeling down."
    re "See you later, Yuki..."
    #Reina sprite fades away
    #Yukiko nervous
    yu "Poor Reina must be really exhausted from all that socializing."
    yu "She doesn't usually talk that much at all."
    mc "How did you become friends?"
    #Yukiko happy
    "She poses her arms on her hips and puffs her chest out proudly."
    yu "I caught her alone in the game lab one day and the rest was history."
    mc "(You caught her..?)" #Italicize caught?
    mc "I'd like to hear more about that potentially incriminating evidence you just--"
    #cockblock phone rings
    mc "Sorry, can I take this?"
    yu "Of course!"
    "I answer my phone to the voice of a friend I made at school."
    mc "What's up? Yeah. Oh, I'm just walking back from around the computer science building. Sounds fun! Okay. Alright, see you then."
    "I was about to hang up when an idea abruptly pops into my head."
    mc "Actually, wait..."

    #Choice A1 - Invite Yukiko to group hangout
    "I put down my phone for a moment."
    mc "Hey Yukiko, wanna go grab a bite with us?"
    #nervous
    "She begins fidgeting and hesitates to answer until I give her an encouraging smile."
    yu "Um, sure."
    "We head to the food court and I grab some overpriced fish tacos."
    "Yukiko just asks for a water cup."
    "....."
    "Time passes as we just chat together about nothing in particular."
    "....."
    "It was a bit awkward, but Yukiko's true personality shined through here and there."
    "My friends part ways for class while getting the wrong idea about Yukiko and I, goading me as they left."
    #calm
    mc "I swear they're nice people."
    yu "You all seem to get along very well."
    #sad
    yu "... I was just being weird."
    mc "No, you weren't being weird. You were fine."
    mc "It's only natural to be a bit reserved when you first meet people."
    #nervous
    yu "Um, [mcname], can I ask you a question?"
    mc "You just did."
    yu "Can I ask you another question after this question?"
    mc "Shoot."
    yu "Um, I just had a feeling, so if I'm totally wrong, just correct me, but..."
    mc "Mmhmm?"
    yu "You seemed like you were making an extra effort involve me in the conversations."
    mc "What made you think that?"
    yu "You were being pretty awkward yourself."
    mc "Ugh..."
    "I feel like I had just been stabbed in the chest.
    mc "So that's how it looked to you."
    #happy
    yu "Thank you, [mcname]."
    "I can't stop my face from flushing slightly as I deny it."
    mc "Nah, I didn't do anything..."
    "I quickly change the subject."
    #calm
    mc "Hey Yukiko, what kind of food do you like?"
    yu "I don't really like food."
    mc "What."
    mc "How can you not like food?"
    #happy
    yu "Aha, sorry. I phrased that wrong."
    #calm
    yu "I try to go as long as possible without eating."
    yu "When I do have to eat, I just inhale the minimum amount of food I need to function and I hurry back to my computer."
    "She picks up one of my fish tacos and devours it one bite to demonstrate."
    mc "MY TACO!!!"
    "I melodramatically agonize over the death of my beloved taco."
    yu "What's in a fish taco?"
    mc "Didn't you just eat it?"
    #nervous
    yu "I didn't taste anything though."
    mc "What a waste...
    "I grit my teeth and clutch my fist while staring downwards to observe a moment of silence for the wasted food."
    #calm
    yu "You know, I do love water though.
    "I couldn't help but stare at her curiously."
    yu "I just have to take a sip and I already feel refreshed."
    yu "I can also keep a bottle next to me at my desk all the time."
    mc "So you're saying bottled water is the best thing to happen since sliced bread?"
    #nervous
    yu "No, [mcname], I'm saying programming is the best thing to happen since bottled water!"
    mc "Or is bottled water the best thing to happen since programming?"
    #calm

    #calm
    yu "Who was that?"
    mc "Just some friends seeing if I want to hang out."
    yu "Shouldn't you go hang out with them?"
    mc "I don't feel like it today."
    #happy
    yu "Uwaaah, [mcname] sure is mean to his friends!"
    mc "Okay, the real reason is that when I meet a new friend, I like to spend time to get to know them."
    yu "Who's that? Have I met them before?"
    "I flash a smile at Yukiko who returns a confused smile."
    mc "(Wait, is she serious?)"
    #calm
    yu "..."
    mc "It's you."
    yu "..."
    yu "Oh! I didn't think of that."

#scene2 player gets a team and help with programming
    "I haven't seen Yukiko since we had lunch together, but we exchanged numbers before we left."
    "We texted each other mostly about random crap, like how four hours of sleep isn't a lot, but a four hour nap is."
    "I sheepishly grin to myself walking to the building where the club meeting is taking place again."
    #SSLH
    mc "(I would be lying if I said I don't look forward to our weird exchanges.)"
    "I enter the lecture hall in the middle of someone's game pitch and get a few looks from the packed audience."
    "I hasten my walk of shame and plop down into the first random seat I could find."
    "The current pitch doesn't catch my interest so my eyes inevitably begin wandering around the room."
    #All the officers' calm sprites except JD together on screen, Reina next to Yukiko with both of them on the right
    "I notice that most of the officers sit together on the stage, maintaining an air of professionalism."
    mc "(What's Yukiko doing?)"
    "I see Yukiko listening to the pitches like the good officer she is."
    mc "Wait..."
    "Now that I look more closely, I notice she is actually staring in the podium's general direction. Her eyes aren't focused."
    "She seems to be silently drumming her fingers on her leg."
    mc "Poor Yukiko..."
    "I silently offer a prayer for her."
    "Her eyes suddenly dart towards my direction."
    mc "(It's just a coincidence, right? Or she could be looking at someone else.)"
    "Her eyes quickly shift back to the direction of the podium."
    "I remind myself that the students pitching the games are putting their ideas out there and deserve respect."
    "The current student's pitch describes programming in lua for a game mod."
    mc "(It can't be THAT game, can it?)"
