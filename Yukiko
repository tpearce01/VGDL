    "I decide that programming sounds interesting so I'm going to try to talk to the programming officer."
    "I heard at the meeting that there are workshops every week about a variety of topics.
    "I check on my phone the date of the next programming workshop."
    "I see the programming officer is... Yukiko."
    "Ah... she's the girl who forcibly escorted me to the club yesterday."
    "She seemed the most approachable out of all the officers, but that might be a problem itself."
    "Oh well. If I want to learn how to program, then she would be the best officer to talk to."
    "What's going to happen to me?"
    "I head over to the game lab to see if she's there."

    mc "Hey, Yukiko."
    yu "Hey, MC, you know I've been wondering for the whoooooooooole day what important thing you could possibly have to tell me at the dead of night."
    mc "Oh yeah, sorry about calling you out this late."
    yu "Don't worry, I don't mind."
    yu "I usually stay up working past this hour anyways!"
    mc "You sure work as hard as ever, huh?"
    yu "When I get in the zone, it I just forget that things are moving around me."
    mc "I really like that about you."
    #Yukiko smiles
    yu "Thanks!"
    #Yukiko tries to make small talk
