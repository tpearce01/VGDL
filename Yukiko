## YUKIKO ROUTE ##

# INTRO SCENE
    #aldrich park or something
    "With my brain freshly laundered by the dull drone of my professor's bored voice from the lecture I just walked out of, I try fruitlessly to stifle a yawn under today's fair weather."
    mc "(I know I shouldn't, but I stayed up last night again.)"
    "I pull out my phone while walking slowly and aimlessly on the park's paths."
    mc "(Yesterday's club meeting was interesting.)"
    mc "(Programming sounds like my cup of tea, so I'm going to try to talk to the programming officer.)"
    "The programming officer's name is... Yukiko?"
    mc "(Ah... she's the girl who forcibly escorted me to the club yesterday.)"
    mc "(She seems the most approachable out of all the officers, but that might be a problem itself.)"
    mc "(Oh well. If I want to learn how to program, then she would be the best officer to talk to.)"
    "I clutch my phone hopefully and shuffle weakly over to the game lab."
    #outside of game lab
    "There's a large sign on the door indicating that food and drink are forbidden."
    #knocking sounds
    #some other officer opens the door drinking soda
    mc "Hi, is the programming officer here right now?"
    re "Sorry, Yukiko isn't here right now..."
    mc "Oh, that's okay."
    mc "I'll come back later."
    #disappear reina!
    "I take my leave while shutting the door at the same time."
    mc ("I actually feel like crashing on the nearest soft surface right now.")
    "I attempt to drag myself back home..."
    #switch to aldrich park
    "... and I end up collapsed in the park on the grass."
    mc "(I can't do it anymore...)"
    mc "(I'll rest my eyes... just for a little...)"
    "My vision fills with black as sleep overtakes me."
    #uh, wait 5 seconds or something?
    mc "Ngh...........nnn."
    mc "Just five more minutes..."
    "I allow my eyes to peek open ever so slightly."
    "An unpleasant orange immediately stains my vision as I realize I am facing the sunset."
    "I turn over onto my other side away from the light."
    "I prepare to shut my eyes to go back to sleep until I notice a faint purple through my eyelashes."
    "Opening my eyes further reveals a rather unexpected scene before me."
    mc "Whoa!"
    "I bolt upwards to a sitting position in surprise."
    "Right in front of me is a girl sleeping peacefully on her back."
    "Her long, straight purple hair is slightly astray with strands wavering in the wind."
    mc "(Actually, this wind is getting really strong.)"
    #a gust of wind?!
    "*SNAP!*"
    "A relatively large branch suddenly falls towards her."
    mc "Get out of the way!"
    "She began to stir."
    "Without thinking, I dash into a standing position with her between and below my legs with my back towards the falling branch's trajectory."
    #close up of Yukiko's calm sprite
    "Her crimson eyes flicker for a moment before dilating and meeting mines, seemingly lasting forever due to the adrenaline."
    "As if she understood just by our brief exchange of gazes, her sleepy face snaps to one of urgency as she suddenly jumped up and tackled me."
    #thud
    mc "OOHOUGH!"
    "I wasn't prepared for a hit by a surprising amount of force from the front, so I toppled backwards onto the grass, disheveled but out of harm's way."
    "The branch hits the ground with a loud crack."
    "We sit there in surreal silence for a few moments before the girl sitting on top of me finally speaks."
    #nervous
    yu "Gosh, what are you doing?"
    yu "That branch almost hit you!"
    mc "Wait, what?!"
    mc "That's my line!"
    mc "A branch fell towards you while you were sleeping and I was trying to block it."
    #calm
    yu "Hmm, that's what happened?"
    mc "Yes, it did..."
    mc "(Why did I even try?)"
    #smile
    yu "C'mon, cheer up!"
    yu "Sorry, I was just teasing you."
    "I put my hand on my forehead in exasperation and suddenly wince in pain."
    #calm
    yu "Oh, you have a cut on your hand."
    "She fumbles around in her pocket for a moment before pulling out two bandaids."
    #happy
    yu "which one would you like?"
    mc "Uhh.."
    yu "Bzzt, time's up; you get both!"
    #calm
    "Her face resets into one of pure concentration."
    yu "Oh wait, I should probably clean this first."
    "She pulls out a handkerchief and gently wipes the blood and dirt from my injury."
    yu "I'm sure I should have put some antiseptic on first, but we don't have that right now..."
    "She tears open a bandaid and carefully places it over my cut, her hands working with an unexpected speed and precision."
    mc "You seem like you're used to this."
    yu "..."
    "She repeats the process except with another bandaid, forming a cross pattern on the back of my hand."
    #happy
    "Admiring her work, she smiles to herself in satisfaction while still sitting on me."
    #calm
    mc "Could you move of--"
    yu "Sorry, did you say something earlier?"
    mc "Oh, uh, you seem like you're used to this."
    #nervous
    yu "Ah, I tend to get little cuts and bruises a lot."
    yu "Sometimes, when I'm walking around and thinking about something, I bump into a whole lot of stuff!"
    mc "Is that why you carry bandaids on you?"
    #happy
    yu "Yep!"
    #calm
    yu "Did they help you feel better?"
    mc "Sure, but why two?"
    yu "It's cooler that way."
    yu "Don't you think it's like some cool symbol thingy on your hand?"
    #happy
    yu "Everyone knows crosses are cooler than straight lines."
    yu "Like, paths having crossed once is more charming than being parallel lines who are always besides each other but will never touch?"
    mc "Couldn't you just use one bandaid though?"
    mc "(God, I'm letting myself get caught up in this girl's pace.)"
    yu "But one bandaid by itself will get lonely."
    #calm
    "The girl directs her eyes upwards and rests an index finger on her chin, as if thinking."
    "I expect another eccentric line out of her but she quickly subverts my expectations again."
    yu "Hey, aren't you [mcname]?!"
    #happy
    "Contrary to what I expected, her face lights up with the intensity of a thousand suns."
    mc "I was looking for you."
    mc "(To be honest, I've never had anyone so earnestly happy to see me before.)"
    mc "(That, and I'm beginning to become more conscious of her weight on me.)"
    "I can feel my face begin tinting a light shade of crimson."
    "She leans in a bit closer despite already sitting on me."
    yu "What can I do for you today?"
    mc "You can get off me first."
    #nervous
    yu "Oh, sorry."
    "She whispers that rather quietly."
    mc "(That was surprisingly meek of her.)"
    #remove her sprite
    "We dust the dirt and plant matter off ourselves."
    #bring her sprite back at a reasonable distance and calm
    mc "Why were you napping next to me?"
    yu "Well, I walked to the game lab and Reina described a male student who was looking for me."
    mc "(I wonder what Reina said about me...)"
    yu "I remembered I abduct -- I mean persuaded a guy matching the description yesterday to join the club."
    #change to happy sprite in the middle of the line? "I mean persuaded"
    mc "(No, you totally kidnapped me.)"
    yu "I was walking back and noticed you napping on the grass."
    yu "You looked so peaceful, I didn't want to wake you."
    #calm
    yu "I sat down waited but the weather was so nice and the wind was so cool."
    yu "The birds were chirping, and the rays of the sun were so warm!"
    mc "Don't worry, I understand. I would have napped too."
    #happy
    yu "Riiiiiight?"
    mc "Now why was I looking for you again?"
    yu "Programming?"
    yu "It's the only thing I do."
    mc "Oh, right, programming!"
    #calm
    yu "What's your experience level?"
    mc "I'm a complete beginner."
    "I look away rather sheepishly."
    #happy
    yu "Don't worry! Learning is what this club is for."
    yu "Everyone starts somewhere."
    mc "When did you start?"
    #fear
    yu "Uhh..."
    mc "Hmm?"
    yu "When I was... six."
    mc "Oh."
    yu "Sorry, I didn't mean to get you down."
    yu "Don't worry [mcname], what we do here is for everybody to learn!"
    #happy
    yu "I'll teach you personally!"
    yu "Or if you would prefer something else, there are a lot of tutorials online on how to get started with Python!"
    yu "Python is what they teach here in the introductory class and it's the easiest to get started with, and--"
    "The school bell chimes."
    mc "Oh crap, I'm gonna be late for my evening lab!"
    #sad
    yu "Oh..."
    "She looks a bit disappointed, but I don't have a choice."
    mc "I'll see you at the programming workshop, okay?"
    mc "(I tell that her gently as if somehow consoling her.)"
    #happy
    yu "Yep!"
    mc "(Well, she got better quickly.)"
    yu "See you later!"
    mc "Bye!"
    yu "By the way, thanks for protecting me!"
    #make her sprite disappear
    "She scurries off before I could say anything else."
    "I turn around and walk away with what must have been a smile on my face."
    "It then occurs to me that I forgot to ask her when the workshop will be."
    #fadeout
#end of intro

#scene1 programming workshop
    #game lab
    #yukiko nervous
    yu "A-and so, for testing code, they say that ninety percent of the work goes into the last ten percent of software, so it's like ten times the effort for a tenth of the fun..."
    "She says all this with strange inflections in her tone of voice."
    yu "(She's so nervous..)"
    "Yukiko proceeds to drop all her notes onto the floor."
    yu "Ahh! I'm so sorry everyone!"
    mc "(Wow, she's a mess right now.)"
    mc "(I don't know much about programming to be able to say anything to help her out.)"
    "A few other students and I stand up to help her gather her dropped papers."
    #fade to black short timeskip
    "The rest of the meeting went shakily but steadily."
    "Much to Yukiko's dismay, a lot of students had questions for her afterwards."
    "I waited until everyone dispersed to approach her."
    #sad yukiko sprite going downwards
    yu "Uuuu..."
    "She slumps down onto a desk in the corner."
    mc "Hey, Yukiko."
    "From the top of the desk, she directs a cute upward gaze against me as if projecting a telepathic barrier with her eyes to prevent any further inquiries."
    "I almost felt like a criminal walking up to her."
    mc "That must have been stressful."
    "Her eyes give up on arresting me and face forward into empty space."
    yu "I wish it wasn't."
    mc "What do you mean?"
    yu "I always get like this with large groups."
    yu "Two is great, three's a party, but any more than that.. I.."
    mc "Get overwhelmed?"
    "She gives a slight nod with her head as much as being on a flat surface would allow."
    mc "You were so talkative when you me though."
    #nervous
    yu "I just woke up from a nap so I was refreshed and the adrenaline of almost being hit by a branch and you seemed like a good person and--"
    "I might be imagining it, but it looks like her eyes are spinning in circles from the speed at which she is looking around."
    mc "Thanks. It wasn't what I expected when I took a nap in the park, but I had fun talking to you."
    #calm
    "Her eyes lock onto me again."
    yu "Really?"
    "She utters that word timidly."
    mc "I mean it. I mean, you seem like a person who would have a lot of friends."
    "As the words left my mouth, I immediately regret speaking before thinking."
    #sad
    "My fears are justified as her hopeful expression undoes itself."
    yu "That's not true, though."
    yu "I've talked to a lot of people here, but I don't have many people I can call a friend."
    yu "Here, maybe only Reina."
    mc "Maybe?"
    #knocking sounds
    "As if we spoke of the devil, Reina suddenly enters the game lab."
    #reina calm sprite entering from the side
    "As she scanned the room for a place to sit, Reina's expression changes from a slight smile upon spotting Yukiko to a slight frown upon seeing me."
    re "Yukiko... is he bothering you?"
    "I involuntarily flinch at the timid girl's sharp words."
    mc "(Now that I think about it, standing over and talking down to Yukiko like this doesn't exactly look very friendly.)"
    mc "Oh sorry, I was just.."
    "Yukiko stands up and suddenly glomps Reina."
    #move a happy Yukiko up and towards Reina surprised
    re "Kyah!"
    yu "Don't worry Reina. He was just comforting me after my big workshop flop."
    #Reina blush and wriggling a bit
    "Reina wriggles around a bit like a captured animal, but quickly lets out a sigh of resignation to her fate."
    #Reina calm
    re "Yukiko, you know the only reason they always have questions is because they aren't getting what you're saying during your presentation."
    #Yukiko sad
    yu "Uuuu..."
    #Reina calm
    re "That being said... if you have any worries... you can just come to me."
    #Yukiko surprised
    "Yukiko's makes a surprised face but quickly turns into sunshines and rainbows in response."
    yu "Reina!"
    "Yukiko holds onto Reina even tighter."
    re "Agh.. I'm choking.."
    #happy
    "She cheers up a bit."
