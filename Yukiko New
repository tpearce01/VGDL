# INTRO SCENE
label yu_intro:
    #aldrich park or something
    "With my brain freshly laundered by the dull drone of my professor's bored voice from the lecture I just walked out of, I try fruitlessly to stifle a yawn under today's fair weather."
    mc "(I know I shouldn't, but I stayed up last night again.)"
    "I pull out my phone while walking slowly and aimlessly on the park's paths."
    mc "(Yesterday's club meeting was interesting.)"
    mc "(Programming sounds like my cup of tea, so I'm going to try to talk to the programming officer.)"
    "I recall there are workshops every week about a variety of topics."
    "I check on my phone the date of the next programming workshop."
    "The programming officer is Yukiko."
    mc "(Ah... she's the girl who forcibly escorted me to the club yesterday.)"
    mc "(She seems the most approachable out of all the officers, but that might be a problem itself.)"
    mc "(Oh well. If I want to learn how to program, then she would be the best officer to talk to.)"
    "I clutch my phone hopefully and shuffle weakly over to the game lab."

    #outside of game lab
    "There's a large sign on the door indicating that food and drink are forbidden."
    #knocking sounds
    #some other officer opens the door drinking soda
    mc "Hi, is the programming officer here right now?"
    re "Sorry, Yukiko isn't here right now..."
    mc "Oh, that's okay."
    mc "I'll come back later."
    "I take my leave while shutting the door at the same time."
    mc ("I actually feel like crashing on the nearest soft surface right now.")
    "I attempt to drag myself back home..."
    #switch to aldrich park
    "... and I end up collapsed in the park."
    mc "(I can't do it anymore...)"
    mc "(I'll rest my eyes... just for a little...)"
    "My vision fills with black as sleep overtakes me."
    #uh, wait 5 seconds or something?
    mc "Ngh...........nnn."
    mc "Just five more minutes..."
    "I allow my eyes to peek open ever so slightly."
    "Orange immediately stains my vision as I realize I am facing the sunset."
    "I turn over onto my other side away from the light."
    "I prepare to shut my eyes to go back to sleep until I notice a faint purple through my eyelashes."
    
    "She abruptly stands up, extends her arms upwards, and arches her back forward in a long stretch."
    yu "*yawn*"
    mc "Hey."
    yu "Hmm?"
    "Her eyes finally land on me and scan me up and down."
    yu "Hey, it's [mcname]!"
    "Contrary to what I expected, her face lights up with the intensity of a thousand suns."
    mc "Yeah, I was waiting for you."
    mc "(To be honest, I've never had anyone so earnestly happy to see me before.)"
    "I can feel my face begin tinting a light shade of crimson."
    "She takes a huge stride into my personal space."
    #yukiko smile
    yu "What can I do for you today?"
    mc "I, uh..."
    mc "(What did I come here for again..?)"
    yu "Did you need help with programming, perhaps?"
    mc "Oh, right."
    yu "What's your experience level?"
    mc "I'm a complete beginner."
    "I look away rather sheepishly."
    yu "Don't worry! Learning is what this club is for."
    yu "Everyone starts somewhere."
    mc "When did you start?"
    #Yukiko nervous
    yu "Uhh..."
    mc "Hmm?"
    yu "When I was... six."
    mc "Oh."
    #Yukiko nervous smile
    yu "Sorry, I didn't mean to get you down."
    yu "Don't worry [mcname], what we do here is for everybody to learn!"
    #Yukiko big smile
    yu "I'll teach you personally!"
    yu "Or if you would prefer something else, there are a lot of tutorials online on how to get started with Python!"
    #Yukiko sparkly eyes ganbatte
    yu "Python is what they teach here in the introductory class and it's the easiest to get started with, and--"
    *The school bell chimes.*
    mc "Ah, I have to get going now."
    mc "My next class is starting soon."
    #Yukiko sad
    yu "Oh..."
    She looks a bit disappointed, but I don't have a choice.*
    mc "I'll see you at the programming workshop, okay?"
    mc "(I tell that her gently as if somehow consoling her.)"
    #back to smiley Yukiko
    yu "Yep!"
    mc "(Well, she got better quickly.)"
    yu "See you later!"
    mc "Bye!"
    mc "(I bid farewell to the other club members in the game lab and leave.)"
    #outdoors UCI walking to class
    mc "(Oh boy, I almost spent a whole hour in there with her.)"
    mc "(Rather, I spent most of that time waiting for her.)"
    mc "(She seems a bit strange, but I think she's a good person at heart, with how much she wanted to help me and all.)"
    mc "Well, that's just based on the meager amount of time we had to make first impressions."
    mc "(I hope I can learn more about programming next time.)"

    #probably a scene of UTC at night
    mc "(Actually managing to call her out here still feels like a dream.)"
    mc "(The cool breeze flowing through the azure night reminds me of time passing by.)"
    mc "(It lulls a me into a reverie of emotional procrastination as I put off processing my feelings of excitement and anxiety.)"
    mc "(The growing sound of rhythmical tapping of boots on concrete breaks me out of my trance.)"
    mc "Hey, Yukiko."
    yu "Hey, MC, you know I've been wondering for the whoooooooooole day what important thing you could possibly have to tell me at the dead of night."
    mc "Oh yeah, sorry about calling you out this late."
    yu "Don't worry, I don't mind."
    yu "I usually stay up working past this hour anyways!"
    mc "You sure work as hard as ever, huh?"
    yu "When I get in the zone, it I just forget that things are moving around me."
    mc "I really like that about you."
    #Yukiko smiles
    yu "Thanks!"
    #Yukiko tries to make small talk
    mc "U-um, let's get to what I came out here to talk to you about!"
    yu "Right, right; sorry for sidetracking."
    mc "Well... you see..."
    yu "Yes?"
