# INTRO SCENE
label yu_intro:
    #aldrich park or something
    "With my brain freshly laundered by the dull drone of my professor's bored voice from the lecture I just walked out of, I try fruitlessly to stifle a yawn under today's fair weather."
    mc "(I know I shouldn't, but I stayed up last night again.)"
    "I pull out my phone while walking slowly and aimlessly on the park's paths."
    mc "(Yesterday's club meeting was interesting.)"
    mc "(Programming sounds like my cup of tea, so I'm going to try to talk to the programming officer.)"
    "I recall there are workshops every week about a variety of topics."
    "I check on my phone the date of the next programming workshop."
    "The programming officer is Yukiko."
    mc "(Ah... she's the girl who forcibly escorted me to the club yesterday.)"
    mc "(She seems the most approachable out of all the officers, but that might be a problem itself.)"
    mc "(Oh well. If I want to learn how to program, then she would be the best officer to talk to.)"
    "I clutch my phone hopefully and shuffle weakly over to the game lab."

#END INTRO SCENE

label yu_scene1:
    #outside of game lab
    "There's a large sign on the door indicating that food and drink are forbidden."
    #knocking sounds
    #some other officer opens the door drinking soda
    mc "Hi, is the programming officer here right now?"
    re "Sorry, Yukiko isn't here right now..."
    mc "Oh, that's okay."
    mc "I'll come back later."
    "I take my leave while shutting the door at the same time."
    mc ("I actually feel like crashing on the nearest soft surface right now.")
    "I attempt to drag myself back home..."
    #switch to aldrich park
    "... and I end up collapsed in the park on the grass."
    mc "(I can't do it anymore...)"
    mc "(I'll rest my eyes... just for a little...)"
    "My vision fills with black as sleep overtakes me."
    #uh, wait 5 seconds or something?
    mc "Ngh...........nnn."
    mc "Just five more minutes..."
    "I allow my eyes to peek open ever so slightly."
    "An unpleasant orange immediately stains my vision as I realize I am facing the sunset."
    "I turn over onto my other side away from the light."
    "I prepare to shut my eyes to go back to sleep until I notice a faint purple through my eyelashes."
    "Opening my eyes further reveals a rather unexpected scene before me."
    mc "Whoa!"
    "I bolt upwards to a sitting position in surprise."
    "Right in front of me is a girl sleeping peacefully on her back."
    "Her long, straight purple hair is slightly astray with strands wavering in the wind."
    mc "(Actually, this wind is getting really strong.)"
    #a gust of wind?!
    "*SNAP!*"
    "A relatively large branch suddenly falls towards her."
    mc "Get out of the way!"
    "She began to stir."
    "Without thinking, I dash into a standing position with her between and below my legs with my back towards the falling branch's trajectory."
    #close up of Yukiko's calm sprite
    "Her crimson eyes flicker for a moment before dilating and meeting mines, seemingly lasting forever due to the adrenaline."
    "As if she understood just by our brief exchange of gazes, her sleepy face snaps to one of urgency as she suddenly jumped up and tackled me."
    mc "OOHOUGH!"
    "I wasn't prepared for a hit by a surprising amount of force from the front, so I toppled backwards onto the grass, disheveled but out of harm's way."
    "The branch hits the ground with a loud crack."
    "We sit there in surreal silence for a few moments before the girl sitting on top of me finally speaks."
    #nervous
    yu "Gosh, what are you doing?"
    yu "That branch almost hit you!"
    mc "Wait, what?!"
    mc "That's my line!"
    mc "A branch fell towards you while you were sleeping and I was trying to block it."
    #calm
    yu "Hmm, that's what happened?"
    mc "Yes, it did..."
    mc "(Why did I even try?)"
    #smile
    yu "C'mon, cheer up!"
    yu "Sorry, I was just teasing you."
    "I put my hand on my forehead in exasperation and suddenly wince in pain."
    #calm
    yu "Oh, you have a cut on your hand."
    "She fumbles around in her pocket for a moment before pulling out two bandaids."
    #happy
    yu "which one would you like?"
    mc "Uhh.."
    yu "Bzzt, time's up; you get both!"
    #calm
    yu "Oh wait, I should probably clean this first."
    "She pulls out a handkerchief and gently wipes the blood and dirt from my injury."
    yu "I'm sure I should have put some antiseptic on first, but we don't have that right now..."
    "She tears open a bandaid and carefully places it over my cut..."
    "... and repeats the process except with another bandaid, forming a cross pattern on the back of my hand."
    yu "All better?"
    mc "Sure, but why two?"
    yu "It's cooler that way."
    yu "Don't you think it's like some cool symbol thingy on your hand?"
    #happy
    yu "Everyone knows crosses are cooler than straight lines."
    #calm
    "The girl directs her eyes upwards and rests an index finger on her chin, as if thinking."
    yu "Hey, aren't you [mcname]?!"
    #happy
    "Contrary to what I expected, her face lights up with the intensity of a thousand suns."
    mc "I was looking for you."
    mc "(To be honest, I've never had anyone so earnestly happy to see me before.)"
    mc "(That, and I'm beginning to become more conscious of her weight on me.)"
    "I can feel my face begin tinting a light shade of crimson."
    "She leans in a bit closer despite already sitting on me."
    yu "What can I do for you today?"
    mc "You can get off me first."
    #nervous
    yu "Oh, sorry."
    "She says that rather quietly."
    mc "(That was surprisingly meek of her.)"
    #remove her sprite
    "We dust the dirt and plant matter off ourselves."
    #bring her sprite back at a reasonable distance and calm
    mc "Why were you napping next to me?"
    yu "Well, I walked to the game lab and Reina described a male student who was looking for me."
    mc "(I wonder what Reina said about me...)"
    yu "I remembered I abduct -- I mean persuaded a guy matching the description yesterday to join the club."
    #change to happy sprite in the middle of the line? "I mean persuaded"
    mc "(No, you totally kidnapped me.)"
    yu "I was walking back and noticed you napping on the grass."
    yu "You looked so peaceful, I didn't want to wake you."
    #calm
    yu "I sat down waited but the weather was so nice and the wind was so cool."
    yu "The birds were chirping, and the rays of the sun were so warm!"
    mc "Don't worry, I understand. I would have napped too."
    #happy
    yu "Riiiiiight?"
    mc "Now why was I looking for you again?"
    yu "Programming?"
    yu "It's the only thing I do."
    mc "Oh, right, programming!"
    #calm
    yu "What's your experience level?"
    mc "I'm a complete beginner."
    "I look away rather sheepishly."
    #happy
    yu "Don't worry! Learning is what this club is for."
    yu "Everyone starts somewhere."
    mc "When did you start?"
    #fear
    yu "Uhh..."
    mc "Hmm?"
    yu "When I was... six."
    mc "Oh."
    yu "Sorry, I didn't mean to get you down."
    yu "Don't worry [mcname], what we do here is for everybody to learn!"
    #happy
    yu "I'll teach you personally!"
    yu "Or if you would prefer something else, there are a lot of tutorials online on how to get started with Python!"
    yu "Python is what they teach here in the introductory class and it's the easiest to get started with, and--"
    *The school bell chimes.*
    mc "Oh crap, I'm gonna be late for my evening lab!"
    #sad
    yu "Oh..."
    She looks a bit disappointed, but I don't have a choice.*
    mc "I'll see you at the programming workshop, okay?"
    mc "(I tell that her gently as if somehow consoling her.)"
    #happy
    yu "Yep!"
    mc "(Well, she got better quickly.)"
    yu "See you later!"
    mc "Bye!"
    yu "By the way, thanks for protecting me!"
    "She runs off before I could say anything else."
    "I walk away with what must have been a smile on my face."

    #probably a scene of UTC at night
    mc "(Actually managing to call her out here still feels like a dream.)"
    mc "(The cool breeze flowing through the azure night reminds me of time passing by.)"

    yu "Hey, MC, you know I've been wondering for the whoooooooooole day what important thing you could possibly have to tell me at the dead of night."
    mc "Oh yeah, sorry about calling you out this late."
    yu "Don't worry, I don't mind."
