Scene 1 - SSLH

mc "(I can't believe I left my phone in the lecture hall...)"
mc "(Crap, crap, crap...)"
mc "(Please let it still be there...)"

"When I entered the lecture hall, I saw Melody drawing graffiti on the far wall.”
"I felt frozen in place. I must have looked like a lunatic, because Melody looked at me strangely."

md "I said HEY!"
mc "Uh, I'm really sorry. I, um, well, I-"
md "What?"
mc "(Pull yourself together. She's not going to jump you.)"
mc "(...)"
mc "(...or will she?)"
md "You gonna talk or just stand there with your mouth open like that?"
mc "(She had come up to me, holding my phone.)"
md "This thing yours?"
mc "That, actually, was, um, my -"
md "Here, have it. I don't want your crappy phone."
mc "Um, thanks."
md "So, I saw you at the meeting last night."
mc "You did?"
md "Sure did. It's nice to see some new faces around here."
mc "Um, thanks?"
md "You're friends with Alex, aren't you?"
mc "Yeah, I am. Why?"
md "Between you and me, I was thinking of bailing this quarter for the club. I can't stand the people."
mc "What!? But, aren't you an officer?"
md "Yup. I gotta put me and my happiness first. But, if you're gonna be around..." 
md "Maybe this quarter won't be as bad as I think."
mc "Oh. Well, I'm glad?"
md "See ya around, newbie. Don't be a stranger."

“As Melody was leaving, Alex made his way inside.”

ax “Hey, what’s taking you so long? You okay?”
mc “Yeah… I just got caught up with talking to Melody.”
ax “The Audio Officer Melody?”
mc “The one and only!”
ax “Hm. So which one of you did the lovely art on the wall?”
mc “That? Oh! Uh, not me!”
ax "Hm. I thought she liked music."
mc "She's multitalented?"
ax "I wouldn't know. I don't really want to know. Wanna grab lunch?"
mc "That sounds great."

LANGSON LIBRARY - Forming Pitch

md "Hey, bromiga."
mc "Bromiga?"
md "It's a combination of 'bro' and 'amiga'. Hence, 'bromiga'."
mc "Oh, well, hey back, bromiga!"
md "No... no, it doesn't sound right coming from you."
mc "Um... okay. Did you need something?"
md "Just thought I'd come by to see what you're up to."
mc "I'm working on my pitch."
md "So you're gonna pitch a game next week?"
mc "Yeah. I'm just not sure what kind I'm going to do."
md "Alex isn't going to be part of your team, is he? I've heard he's like, your best friend or something."
mc "I'm not sure yet."
md "I'll join your team if you can promise me that he won't join it."
mc "Uh... do you mind me asking why I couldn't have both of you guys?"
md "We don't work well together."

2 Options
[Option 1] - Ditch Alex
mc "(I felt bad about ditching Alex, but at the same time, to have someone as talented as Melody...)"
mc "Okay, it's a deal."
md "Wow, really?"
mc "Yeah. I could really use someone with a good music background for my game."
md "Well, now I'm curious what kind of game you're gonna pitch."
mc "
md "You're not gonna regret this, (Y/N). Here's my number."

[Option 2] - Don't Ditch Alex
mc "(As much as I wanted to work with someone as talented as Melody, I couldn't ditch Alex...)"
mc "I'm sorry. I can't make that kind of a deal."
md "Look, you're new here, so I won't take it too personally. But, I don't take no for an answer."
mc "Is that like, a threat or something?"
md "It sure is. Look, we're pitching together next week. Here's my number, (Y/N)."
mc "But, Alex..."
md "Isn't a part of our team, got it? Me and (Y/N), an unstoppable team."

(Melody Leaves, and Alex arrives)


ax "Hey! What's up?"
mc "Nothin' much."
ax "So, you ready to think of a pitch?"
mc "Um, the thing is... I'm gonna pitch with Melody."
ax "Oh. I see. Is that why she was here?"
mc "Yeah. What happened between you two?"
ax "Why don't you ask her yourself?"
mc "(Alex left without saying another word.)"

SSLH - Pitching Game



???? - Video Game Related



"Melody sent me a text a few minutes later."

mc "(We should get together to talk about the game.)"
mc "(Meet me outside the student center tonight.)"

STUDENT CENTER - Path Divergence

md "Oh, (Y/N), you're finally here!"
mc "Hey. What's up?"
md "I need you to help me with something."
mc "I'll do what I can!"
md "That's hella sweet. So, I need your help in pranking Alex."
mc "I don't know. Why? What did he do?"
md "He tried to get me kicked out of the club because of my project last quarter."
mc "What kind of a game was it?"
md "There were parts that he considered "deplorable content" and it shouldn't have been made."
mc "But you're only the audio officer. Was it really that bad?"
md "He just can't appreciate actual talent when he sees it."
mc "He's my friend though..."
md "That's exactly why I need you to help me out. You can help me get to him."

CHOICE A - "Okay, I'll help you."
mc "You're right. Let's teach him a lesson!"
md "I knew you were gonna come through for me!"
mc "Hey, we're a team now!"
mc "(And I'd do anything for someone so cute...)"
md "I gotta say... I really wasn't expecting you to say yes."
mc "He's kind of been a jerk lately."

CHOICE B - "No, I don't think so..."
mc "I can't do that. Not to my best friend."
md "That's weak, bromiga."
mc "It's not that I don't want to help you. I just don't want to do anything nasty to my best friend."
md "Oh, no, I get it."
mc "(Her tone wasn't convincing at all. She actually looked really hurt.)"
mc "We're still cool with the game thing?"
md "I guess so. There's nothing I can say to make you change your mind?"
mc "Not really."
md "Fine. I'll text you tomorrow."

CHOICE A
[scene 1]
"I almost texted Alex to let him know the situation."
"But all his secrets, his attitude... I didn't like it."
"Maybe he deserved this."

md "So, I've finally got the details planned out."
mc "I'm ready for anything. What are we gonna do? Key his car?"
md "Oh, that's a good idea. Let's do that, and then my thing."
mc "What did you have in mind?"
md "It may take some time and patience, so bear with me here. But we're gonna sabotage his project."
mc "How?"
md "Well, first, he keeps a copy of all his gaming stuff in the DBH gaming lab."
mc "What do we do until then?"
md "

[scene 3]
ax "(Y/N)? Melody? What are you doin' with our stuff?"
mc "Alex! You're here late."
ax "Yeah, I wanted to grab the copy of our stuff, since the first one was..."
mc "(Melody had a malicous look on her face.)"
md "Was WHAT, Alex?"
ax "You two destroyed our project. And you're destroying the copy."
md "Oh, clap, clap, clap. A-plus, Mr. Designer Boy."
ax "(Y/N), how could you do this to me?"

2 Options
[Option 1 - Take Melody's side]

[Option 2 - Take Alex's side]

[end]
md "Look, I'm... I didn't mean to destroy your friendship with Alex."
mc "I don't think what you did was right. But what he did was even worse."
md "So, forgive me?"
mc "I can't stay mad at someone so beautiful."
md "Shut up. You're gonna make me blush. I can't be seen blushing."

CHOICE B
[scene 1]
"The first thing I did was text Alex."
mc "(We need to talk. Pronto.)"
ax "(I'm busy tonight. First thing tomorrow morning?)"
mc "(Yeah, fine. First thing at the Food Court.)"

mc "Oh geez... I got a text from Melody."
ax "What'd she say?"
mc "(

[scene 2]
"Melody was waiting for me when I got out of class."
md "Fancy seeing you here."
mc "You're not still mad, are you?"
md "Me? Nah. We're still a part of team, remember? Still gotta finish that."
mc "O-of course!"

[scene 3]
"I thought that a fight was going to break out between the two."
md "Stole her? From you? In your freakin' dreams."
ax "I'm only saying this one more time - lay off her."

[end]
md "I really wish that things had turned out different between us."
mc "I kind of did too. You're talented, and smart..."
md "Loyalty is everything. And you did nothing to help me."
