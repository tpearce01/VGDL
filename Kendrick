(Scene 1)

(teams formulated. Kendrick is the officer buddy of the group)
Kd “Now that the roles have been assigned it’s time to hit the ground running. I’ll be here if you need help.”
“Kendrick looks determined, maybe he really liked my game idea. I’m feeling good about this, I gotta be enthusiastic too”
Mc “I’m hype! I promise that I’m going to produce the heck out of this, I’m ready to roll!”
“I put my hands on my hips and puff my chest out proudly, everyone seems to be excited to roll, but Kendrick looks at me with a “what the hell are you doing expression”, maybe a bit too enthusiastic?”
Mc “B-but remember guys, the most important thing is to h-have fun, hehe”
Kd “I don’t know if you’re aware of this, but VGDC is a serious club.”
Mc “h-haha I know, bu-”
kd “For gods sake, the people in our organization have gone on to work at the greatest companies the gaming industry has to offer, this isn’t a happy go lucky lets make friends and play patty cake baby club, if that’s what you were expecting, you should leave”
“jesus whats his problem, I didn’t even say anything, maybe this is a comedy bit? Maybe he thinks he’s being funny by being a douchebag?”
Mc “pshhhh alright dude lmaoooo”
“I look at my fellow club members and motion to Kendrick”
Mc “can you believe this guy? Whats up his butt?”
“nobody is laughing, I’m starting to figure out that this isn’t a comedy thing. Oh god think I’ve made this already uncomfortable situation worse”
Kd “get out”
Mc “I-Im sorry, i thought we were doing a bit”
Kd “a bit?”
Mc “l-like you were joking”
Kd “why would I be joking?”
Mc “c-cuz u were being super serious, I-I thought you were trying to scare us”
Kd “I never joke. You might think that your game, and probably your life, Is a joke, but I’m actually trying to get things done”
“dang he didn’t have to bring my life into this, I guess he’s right though, still he didn’t have to be mean”
Mc “m-my bad dude, I just misread the situation is all, I’m sorry”
Kd “its okay, just don’t make the mistake again, get to producing, we meet here next week at the same time, dismissed”
“I already hate college, I knew I should have gone to UC Riverside”



“I got everyone’s phone number and email at the meeting, I figured it would be best to set up a discord and contact everyone online”
“all the invitations had been sent in class, now I just had to wait for everyone to join”
“once everyone joined, I figured I would get the ball rolling, try to get everyone to introduce themselves, that whole bit”
“I’ve always been better at online conversation anyways, they can think I suck irl, but online maybe they can at the very least tolerate me”
Mc “alright guys, thank you so much for joining my game crew, I figured it would be fun to introduce ourselves, tell us you’re name, your year, ya major, and fun fact about yourself”
“nobody is typing, dang, I guess I will have to get started”
Mc “my name is MC, I’m a first year, my major is undecided haha, and I was really into dinosaurs when I was a kid, other girls wanted to be princesses and all that, not fam, I wanted to be trex lol”
Kd “nobody cares, we should have made a slack, people get way to distracted on discord”
Mc “I decided to post a picture of a sad cat, with the text, “I’m sorry””
Kd “you’re posting memes? Jesus Christ, please quit”
“does this guy hate me personally or something, did I do something to him in the past that I don’t remember”
Mc “are you okay dude?”
Kd “yes, I’m just frustrated that every year I get assigned groups led by little kids who don’t know the responsibilities that come with leading a video game development club”
Mc “dude, I don’t think I’ve even done anything to make you think that I’m not capable of leading this team, making this video game has been my dream since I was 8”
Kd “then why haven’t you made it yet?”
Mc “I don’t, I don’t know how to make games, hence why I joined this club?”
Kd “I also wanted to make a game when I was 8, and when I was 9 the game was already done. I know what kind of person you are, you like to daydream and think about all the cool things that you would someday do, but the day never comes, I’m sick of having to be assigned people like you”
“man, that cuts deep, he’s right though, I always have these fad dreams that never actually pan out, doing karate, becoming a singer, getting into UCLA”
“who’s to say that this game won’t just be another thrown away dream in my sea of unfulfilled dreams”
“damn, I’m tearing up, its moments like these that make me glad to be online”
“I really am a failure, I’m always going to be a failure”
“no”
“NO”
“NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO”
“didn’t I tell myself I was going to change, I’m at a new school, its time for a fresh start, and it starts now!”
“besides, who does this guy think he is? He doesn’t know me? For all he knows I could be a genius programmer, a fisherman, a ski instructor”
“this guy hasn’t even known me for a whole day and already thinks he has me pinned down?”
“JESUS CHRIST I HATE THIS GUY”
“if I don’t change for myself, I’m going to change out of spite, to prove this pretentious freak wrong”
“I’m going to play it cool, I’m happy again that I’m online and can pretend”
Mc “dude calm down, get some sleep, it’s true that I don’t have experience making games, but I got pretty good grades and was community service club vice president in high school, I’m sorry for your past experiences, but I can assure, this is not it”
Kd “we’ll see”
“he went ofline”








(Scene 2)

--A sky or something?--

"I definitely didn't like him, but I couldn't say I hated him either."
"Kendrick was an amazing producer, no doubt about it. But as a team-mate... not so much."
"A couple meetings had passed. We're 2 weeks into the game's development."
"At this point, I'd hoped he would've lightened up around us, or at least be more bearable to be around."
"But nothing changed. Kendrick's still as cold as ever."
"After communicating with him these past few days, I'd gotten used to his rude remarks towards my work ethics."
"They stung at first, sure, but objectively speaking, they were all valid."
"I mean, that doesn't mean he couldn't have been a little nicer about it."

"(So long as things keep going like this, I can pull through.)"
