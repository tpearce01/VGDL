mc "(Production, huh...)"
mc "Hmmm..."
"As Jeorge Dan resumed his presentation, I considered the appeal of joining the productions department."
mc "(The other departments are interesting, but it'd be nice to get some leadership experience.)"
mc "(That, and I've always wanted to lead a game of my own...)"
"Since I could remember, I've been making up video games in my head, some more complex than others."
"I'd always wanted to bring at least one of those ideas to life, but never had the resources to do so."
"That is, until now."
mc "(But... should I?)"
mc "...."
mc "..."
mc ".."
mc "(Ah, well. What have I got to lose, right?)"
mc "(This is my first quarter here in UCI. Let's hit the ground running!)"
"Just as I'd come to a conclusion, the room errupted in applause."
"People started getting up and Jeorge Dan began tidying the podium."
mc "(Looks like the meeting's over.)"
"I got up from my chair and merged into the sea of fleeing college students and started mulling over my game."
mc "(Alright, my first project shouldn't be too ambitious.)"
mc "(Now to think of something simple and entertaining...)"

--Outside SSLH--

"A week later. Day of the game pitches."
mc "(Inhale.)"
mc "(Exhale.)"
mc "(Alright. I'm good... I'm alright!)"
mc "(I totally didn't arrive at the club meeting hall hours early out of anxiety or anything, nope. I'm just super responsible.)"
"I sighed and looked up to the sky. The sun was still out; I had a long way to go until the meeting starts."
mc "(Well... Might as well go over my pitch a few times, right?")
mc "(First, I introduce the game...)"
"The game I'd decided on creating was something I came up with as a child."
"It's called 'Tyrannosaurus Wreck!'"
"The game is a platformer with a comedic storyline. I chose this idea for its charm and simple mechanics."
"To summarize, the game takes place during prehistoric times. Asteroids hit the earth, but instead of killing the dinosaurs, they crack open to reveal weapons."
"Brutish vegetarian dinosaurs monopolize the weapons, and begin to raid small, adorable, carniverous dinosaurs."
“The protagonist of the story is a T-rex whose adoptive family is held captive by the evil vegetarians."
"Being a T-rex, they can't exactly wield weapons very well, what with their tiny arms. So, the player destroys the weapons to defeat enemies."
"The goal of the game is to destroy all weapons and rescue the family."
mc "(It'll be a quarter-long project... all skills and experience levels welcome... aaaaand, yea. That should be it.)"
"I took another deep breath."
mc "(Alright. I'll be fine. I'll be good.)"
mc "(The team will be dedicated yet comfortable, we'll get along great, and I won't regret a thing.)"
mc "(...)
mc "(...Hopefully.)"

--Black--

"In the end, my pitch went on without a hitch."
mc "(The crowd seemed to take interest, so I'm off with a good start."
"Encouraged by these thoughts, I finished off the rest of the week strong."

--Inside SSLH--

"The following meeting, day of our team assignments."
"My team gathered around our officer buddy, Kendrick."
mc "(So we got the productions officer, huh? He seemes rough around the edges, but reliable none the less.)
kd "All of you are members for the team 'Tyrannosaurus Wreck' correct?”
"We all nodded."
kd "Very well then. My name is Kendrick, and I will be aiding you all in your efforts to develop this game."
kd "If you need any assistance with anything, know that I, along with your team lead, will always be available."
"He met everyone's gaze as he spoke. He sounded sincere and determined, and I couldn't help but be impressed."
mc “(I thought he'd be a little harder to warm up to, but it looks like I was wrong. What a pleasant surprise!)" 
kd "With that said, I will now allow [mcname] to take over."
"He turned to me and gave me a nod, to which I returned."
mc "(I’m feeling good about this, I have to be enthusiastic!)"
mc "(Let's start off with a brief introduction, then I'll get everyone's contact information.)"
mc "Hello everyone! I'm [mcname], and I'm the team lead for this project."
mc "Words can not express how stoked I am to have you all on my team. Thank you all for your interest, it really means a lot!"
mc "To start off, let's have everyone join the Discordance server, then write down your contact information."

--transition to indicate time skip--

mc "Phew..."
"The meeting had come to a conclusion, and my team had disbanded for the day."
"I had talked for quite a bit. Only a few more people remained in the meeting room."
"Whilst surveying the area, I caught sight of Kendrick gathering his belongings."
mc "(Hmmm... Would he mind if I spoke to him?)"
"Aside from introducing himself at the beginning, he hadn't spoken a word during our little meeting."
mc "(I'd really like some advice from him...)"
"After a moment of contemplation, I decided to approach him."
mc "(He's my officer buddy, after all. I should be comfortable with him.)"
mc "Umm... Excuse me, Kendrick?"
kd "..."
"His eyes snapped up to me, making me stop in my tracks."
"Unlike earlier, his gaze was much colder, and I found it difficult to speak up."
mc "Umm..."
kd "Well? Speak up."
mc "gulp."
mc "Err, I-I just wanted see if you had any... uh... a-advice?"
"I unintentionally stutter as his piercing glare cracked my confidence. Kendrick sighed in response."
kd “I don’t know if you’re aware of this, but many elements must come together harmoniously when developing a platformer game.”
kd "Communicating with all your teammates and scheduling properly for a quarter project is no easy task."
mc “I... understand."
"Kendrick raised an eyebrow."
kd "Do you? Your demeanor during today's meeting told me otherwise."
mc "My demeanor? What do you mean?"
kd "You were far too colloquial. You did not establish yourself as a reliable leader figure."
mc "(...? The heck?)"
//---------->CHOICE<----------

[pos option- "Isn't that a bit too serious?"
mc "Umm... Although I understand where you're getting at, don't you think you're taking this way too seriously?"
mc "My game is short, sweet, and fun. What more... this is just a club, isn't it?"

[neg option- "I'm sorry."]
mc "I'm sorry..."
mc "I just thought that maybe, it'd be nice if we could all get along."

//----------------------------
"I could see Kendrick twitch at my comment, and he intensified his glare."
kd "Treat something as though it were a joke, and your product will be become just that."
kd “I, for one, never joke. Unlike you, I’m actually trying to get things done, so I hope you'll be understanding of my actions and position."
kd "All my projects thus far have been a success. You could gain from learning a thing or two from me."
mc "Ngh..."
"I wanted to talk back, but I held my breath."
"That, and although he was disrespectful, this kind of outlook could only be beneficial to the game's development."
"I took a deep breath."
mc "(He... just wants the best for the game. For our team.)"
"I told this to myself, effectively calming me down."
mc “I understand. You are entirely correct. I appologize for what I said.”
kd "... Hmph.”
"He finished packing his things and put on his bag."
kd "... The game in itself has potential."
mc "!!"
kd "It caters to a large audience. I have faith in the product."
"Just as he turned to leave, he looked back at me.
kd "You on the other hand, I am less than confident in."
kd "I sincerely hope you prove me wrong."
"With that, he left."
mc "..."
mc "(What... the heck was that?)"
mc "(Is the guy with me, or against me?)"
"Still reeling from Kendrick's comment, I slowly headed out of the lecure hall."
mc "(One thing's for sure, he seems like a tough guy to get along with. I hope he'll warm up to me eventually...)"

--MC room--
--Phone thing--

mc "Hmmm"
"I sat on my bed, the team's Discordance server opened on my phone."
"I've set up all the channels, and all the members have been added, but it's completely empty. No one has spoken yet."
mc "(I think I'll start things off and break the ice.)"
mc “Alright guys, thank you so much for joining my game crew! Though announcements will be handled here, feel free to chat and meet one another in the off-topic channel."
"I decided to tag on an image of a happy anime character to loosen up the atmosphere."
mc "Aaaand, send."
"To my surprise, it was Kendrick's username that started typing."
kd “A work environment should be treated as a work environment. I see no reason for allowing tomfoolery.”
mc "..."
mc "I think a bit of 'tomfoolery' would be good. Helps establish a sense of comraderie, y'know?"
kd "How absolutely disappointing."
mc "...."
mc “(Did I do something to him in the past that I don’t remember?)”
mc “Are you okay?”
kd “Fantastic, I’m just frustrated that every year, I get assigned groups led by children who don’t understand the responsibilities that come with leading a video game development team.”
mc “I don’t think I’ve even done anything to make you think that I’m not capable of leading this team.”
mc "Producing my own game had been a dream of mine since primary school y'know."
kd “Then why haven’t you made it yet?”
mc “I don’t know how to make games, which is why I joined this club.”
kd “You like to daydream and think about all the cool things that you would someday do, but the day never comes; I’m sick of having to be assigned people like you.”
mc “(...Geez, that cuts deep.)" 
mc "(He’s right that I haven't done anything until now, but there's no excusing his horrible attitude.)" 
"I click my tongue in annoyance, my mind whirring with anger."
mc “(Besides, who does this guy think he is? He doesn’t know me! For all he knows I could be a genius programmer, a fisherman, a ski instructor...)”
mc “(This guy hasn’t even known me for a whole day and already thinks he has me pinned down?)”
mc “(If I don’t change for myself, I’m going to change out of spite, to prove this pretentious freak wrong!)”
"I take a deep breath."
mc “(Alright, but let's play it cool. Nothing will come from acting on emotion...)”
mc "(Rational thoughts, [mcname], rational...)"
mc “Just calm down and get some sleep, Kendrick. It’s true that I don’t have experience making games, but I got pretty good grades and held leadership roles in high school."
mc "I’m sorry about your past experiences, but I can assure you that this is not the case.”
kd “We’ll see...”
“He goes offline.”
mc "..."
mc "(Welp. So much for breaking the ice.)"
"With my impression of Kendrick lower than ever, I pull the covers over my head and go to sleep."

--Game room--

"We had our first real team meeting a few days after. Everyone showed up, including Kendrick."
"After setting up our Bithub, I set up a schedule for the rest of the quarter. 
"On Kendrick's recommendation, we'll be meeting up twice a week."

--black--

"..."
"It's been two weeks since then. We've had a total of five meetings."
"Kendrick showed up to each one and observed the team working."
"At every opportunity, he'd point out a flaw in my work or leadership."
"At first, I'd get irritated by it. But with time, I'd gotten used to his harsh nature."
"Every meeting, I'd just take whatever he threw at me. Because as much as I'd hate to admit it, he'd bring up some pretty valid points."
"So long as it were just me, I thought I'd be able to get through the quarter just baring it all."
"One meeting at a time."
"One insult at a time."
"It'd all work out, eventually."
"..."
"It didn't last long until I was proven wrong."

--game room--

"It was the second meeting of the week."
"Midway in, the more inexperienced of my artists approached me with their laptop in their hands."
tm "[mcname]? Can I get your input on the background for the game?"
mc "Sure! Lemme take a look at it."
"He placed the laptop in front of me." 
mc "Hmmm..."
"Although a valiant effort for a newbie artist, the backrgound was riddled with imperfections. It was clearly done by an amateur."
mc "(Still, nothing a little elbow grease can't fix.)"
"I was about to explain how to fix the piece, when the person next to me spoke up."
kd “No, this is garbage, do it again.”
mc "!! Kendrick, what the heck?!"
kd "What? It's bad. Plain and simple."
"From the corner of my eye, I could see my artist siffen and meddle with his fingers."
tm ”I-I see... Umm, what about it do you want me to fix?”
"I turned to him, and put on my most comforting smile possible."
mc “It’s mostly fine! Just maybe color inside the lines a little more.”
kd “Don’t listen to her. You're better off doing it again”
mc “What part?”
kd “All of it. Redo it completely.”
tm "U-Umm... Are you sure I can't-?"
kd "Don't make me repeat myself. Stop wasting time and do as you're told."
mc "(How could he say that?!)"
//-------->CHOICE<-----------

[pos option- "Enough is enough!!"]
mc "Enough is enough."
"I slam my hands on the table and stand from my seat."
mc "You wanna know something, Kendrick?"
kd "..."
"Kendrick remained in his seat; he was as calm and composed as ever, and his cold gaze never faltered as he met my own."
kd "I'm listening."
mc "It's just... It's mind boggling how you don't even realize how much of a giant, pedantic poop hole you are, and to your own club members!”
kd “Poop hole?”
mc "I’m talking about your mouth, insinuating that what comes out of it is pure poop, it's poetic.”
kd “I don’t see why you’re so mad. The art is garbage, the drawing is chicken scratch, the coloring goes out of the lines."
kd "It's unoriginal and uninspired. I could go on, but for the sake of time, I felt that “it's garbage” would suffice.”
mc “Okay, first of all, it's not even that bad. Second of all, you could have shown him what he’s doing right and what he could improve on."
mc "How is he going to get better if all you can do is say “it's garbage” and denounce the drawing he worked hard on?”
kd “I told you, this is a serious club. I’m not here to hold your hands and nurture you from my teet like a little baby."
kd "You are all grown adults and are expected to behave as such.”
mc “You keep going on about serious this club is and this and that, but I’ve spoken to the other teams."
mc "All of them have nothing but nice things to say about their officer buddies, so it's really just you.”
kd “It's usually just me taking work seriously, that’s why I was one of the only ones who has had internships at Binbendo."
kd "You think this type of art and behavior in general is going to pass at a legit workspace where making games is what puts food on the table?”
mc “This is a club, not a full time job, so making this video game isn’t life or death for me.”
kd “It is for me.”
"I clicked my tongue at him."
mc “Well then, I think you should go and find more people who are willing to put up with your bull.”

[neg option- Please stop doing this...]
mc "Kendrick, I don't like the way you treat our team members. Please stop..."
kd "What?"
mc "Err, it's just... In all honesty, I'd rather you... leave us be."

//----------------------------
kd "..."
kd “Is that what you all think?”
mc “(Everyone looks at each other, one person starts nodding, everybody nods.)”
kd “Hmph. It seems as though my presence is but a hinderance to production."
kd "In that case, I will be taking my leave."
"Kendrick stood up, and left the game room."
"My teams' eyes were downcast; the atmosphere was evidently too tense to resume working."
mc "Hey, come on guys, perk up!"
"They all turned to me, and I smiled in turn."
mc "Come on everyone, we have no reason to act so dour. Let's end the meeting strong, yea?"

--mc room--

mc "Uuuugghh...."
"Emotionally drained, I plopped on my bed and buried my head in my pillow."
mc "(I've handled Kendrick no ploblem these past few days."
mc "(If only he could've kept his words targeted at me, I could've kept things going. Ridicule my team member, however...)"
"I bit my lip as anger began to well inside me.'
mc "Tch..."
mc "(I don't want anyone from my team to be treated with disrespect. Never.)"
mc "(There's only one way to assure this..."
--phone screen--
"I pulled up the club president's account from the VGDC Discordance server, and sent him a message."
mc "/"Excuse me, Jeorge Dan? I have a request to make./""
"I was relieved to see he started typing right away."
jd "/"Yes? What is it?/""
mc "/"I'm the project lead for Tyrannosaurus Wreck. Kendrick was assigned to us as our officer buddy, but he's been incredibly disrespectful./""
mc "/"If possible, I would like to have him replaced or removed. I can't stand to see any of my members treated to poorly./""
mc "/"Any and all help for the matter would be greatly appreciated./""
"......"
"...."
"There was a pregnant pause before Jeorge Dan began to reply."
jd "/"Understood. I'll do what I can./""
mc "(Thank goodness...)"
"I thank him, then worked for the rest of the night."

--DBH Lobby--

> JD asks Protag to come to the game lab late at night when no one’s there. Surprise! Kendrick’s there. 
"The next day..."
"I recieved a message from Jeorge Dan asking me to come to DBH late at night."
"By late, I mean super late at night."
"I was all alone, sitting in the lobby. The game room was locked and barren."
mc "What's this all about, Mr.President..?"
mc "It's freezing outside. I'd much rather be within the warm confines of my room instead of here."
"As I was grumbling to myself, I heard the door to the building open."
jd "[mcname]. Thank you for coming despite the abrupt nature of my message."
jd "Part of me was worried I called for you too late and you wouldn't show up."
mc "Yep. Same here."
jd "Heh. My apologies."
mc "So. Why did you ask for me so late?"
"Just as he was about to respond, the door began to open once more."
kd "..."
mc "Kendrick?!"
kd "Hmph... Leave it to JD to devise such a tasteless scheme."
"Jeorge Dan just smiled in response as he walked up to Kendrick, and ushered him closer to me."
"It was evident from his scowl that he'd much rather turn heel and run, but I'm sure his sense of duty mandated otherwise."
"He stood before me. The only one smiling was Jeorge Dan, either hand placed on each of our backs."
mc "..."
kd "..."
jd "..."
jd "Alright. Make nice, kiddos."
"He gave us a pat, and turned to leave."
kd "... Pardon?"
mc "Wha?! Hold up, are you just going to leave us?"
"With no intention to even turn my direction, Jeorge Dan left the building."
"And just like that, I was left alone with Kendrick."
mc "(Ngh... Dang that guy...)"
“Silence fell. It'd only been a moment, but each agonizing, awkward second felt like a minute."
kd "..."
"For better or for worse, it was Kendrick who broke the ice."
kd "We both know why JD pitted us together here, so let's cut to the chase."
kd "I've given nothing but my best effort to your project, and yet you request an officer change?"
kd "Truly, I don't understand your issue is here. Why didn’t you just communicate with me?”
mc "(Tch. If I were able to, I wouldn't have a problem with you in the first place!)"
mc “Why would I bother even trying when the answer would be “it's garbage” anyways?"
"At this, Kendrick's eye sharpened. He clicked his tongue in irritation."
kd “That’s rich, coming from someone who responded just as much immaturity as you claim I am.”
mc "Ugh..."
"I realized I was letting my anger get the best of me."
"I took a deep breath, and glared him straight in the eye."
mc "You want me to communicate with you? Fine. I will."
mc "You're horribly self centered. All you think about is yourself, and getting work done because YOU want to."
mc "Do you even realize that the people you're talking to have feelings? Have you ever acknowledged someone for working?"
mc "There's more to production than just the product, Kendrick. You may be an officer, but I refuse to acknowledge you as a leader."
mc "At least, not for my project."
kc "..."
mc "..."
mc "It's late. I'll be taking my leave now."

--Black-- (Kendrick's POV)
"After her little spewl, [mcname] left the bulding."
"Occaisionally, she would just say what she pleases. Each time, I would just dismiss it as nonsense.
"After all, ignorant people say ignorant things. I considered her no different."
"But now..."

"I made sure to bring my water canister before I left for class."
"What I dreaded most, though, was neither the weather nor my lectures."

mc “...”
kd "..."
"I showed up to the meeting and set my bottle down on the table."
"I pulled up a chair before Kendrick."
mc "I'm honestly surprised you're here."
kd "... As am I."
"Eventually, the rest of the team trickled in."
"Everyone worked as normal. It'd be just another work meeting if it weren't for one thing."
"Kendrick was much, much quiter."
"He barely spoke up, and when he did, they'd be quick, almost curt acknowledgments of the team's work."
"It was undeniably odd. I'd see members glance up at Kendrick in confusion throughout our time there."
mc "(It may just be wishful thinking on my part, but I can't help but wonder...)" 
"I thought to myself as I reached for my water."
mc "(Is he... trying to change..?)"
"BAM!!"
kd "!!"
mc "?! O-Oh god, I'm so sorry-!!"
"Water spilled across the table and dripped from Kendrick's laptop."
"My hand bumped into my canister and toppled it over. The cap of my seemed to have been loosely screwed on, and popped off upon impact."
"I repositioned the bottle as fast as I could while Kendrick stood, his laptop in his hands and off the table."
kd "You... insufferable, clumsy little--"
mc "I-I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
"I bowed my head in apology."
tm "H-Hey, the laptop's fine, right? There's no need to be so--"
mc "No, no he's right. This was a stupid mistake on my end that could've easily been avoided."
kd "Ngh..."
"Kendrick grounded his teeth, his mind undoubtedly racing."
"A moment later, he took a deep breath, and set his laptop down somewhere dry."
kd "Ahem... [mcname]."
"I slowly raised my head to look at him. His expression was calm, but for some reason he struggled to keep eye contact."
mc "...?"
kd "I... recognize this was out of your control."
kd “In fact, I apologize. For... being quite brash and inconsiderate.”

mc “Hmmmm... nope~! Quite the opposite actually." 
"I giggled and dug through my pockets."
mc "Let's see... ah! Here, have a mint as a reward, and also for positive reinforcement.”
"I popped a capsule out of the mint container and presented it to him. Kendrick frowned, but accepted the 'reward' none the less."
kd “What am I, a dog?”
mc “Ehhh... that would be an insult to dogs.”
kd “Tch. Whatever.”
"Despite his protesting, he popped the mint into his mouth. I couldn't help but feel pleased."

kd "Shut up. You're annoying."
mc "Hehe~ Sorry, sorry!"
mc "Mmmm... but, you know. I'm actually really happy that you're making an effort to change."
mc "I dreaded the rest of this project, in all honestly. But now... I'm really excited to be working with you."
mc "Thanks for putting the effort, Kendrick."

mc “(Alright, I had my fill.)”
mc “Sorry man, I’m just teasing you.”
kd “Get to work.”

> “... Hold on. Did I actually just think that”
mc “(Dang, I can’t believe he actually listened to it, it was kinda cute to watch him deny it so vehemently.)”
mc “(Wait, wait wait wait, did I just think he was cute, AGAIN?)”

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**[Kendrick confesses. Protag recognizes her feelings for him.]


>Another time skip. Game finished Monologue about how Kendrick’s pretty dang chill.
mc “(A couple of weeks have passed, and Kendrick has actually gotten super chill.)”
mc “(Well, not chill by normal human standards, but compared to the huge pedantic butthole that he was when we met him....)”

>All of a sudden…
> “I like you. Please go out with me.”
mc “(Its 1 am, he told me to meet him outside SSLH 100, I think its to turn in some hand drawn art, we’re approaching the deadline so we’re in overtime.)”
mc “(I borrow my room mate’s scooter, and head out.)”
mc “(I scoot for a bit, see some dance crews practicing,)”
mc ”(can’t believe dance crews practice at this hour)”
mc “(I arrive and see him sitting down against the building, his dark silhouette contrasting with the building lights)”
mc “Yo whats with the dramatic setting my man”
kd “….”
mc “Either you want me to take a picture for a mixtape cover, or you’re going to confess to me hahaha”
kd “….”

mc “(Suddenly, the setting makes a lot of sense.)”
mc “(Am I dreaming, this doesn’t even feel real.)”
mc “(This is NOT a dream...)”
mc “(This is a real thing, that is happening to me, right now.)”

>Starts freaking out. Super flustered. She never considered her feelings to be like that. Says she needs time. Kendrick accepts
mc “Uuuuuhhhhhh...”

[GOOD END]


1. Kendrick sees how Protag has difficulty talking to him and asks her to forget he ever confessed. This pushes protag to confess to him and they go out

--black--

"It's been some weeks since Kendrick confessed."
"He'd tried to converse with me on several occaisions, but each time I'd either avoid it, or cut it short."
"I know it's horribly rude of me."
"I know I'm just running away from him."
"I know he must be hurting."
"But I... just don't know how to face him."
kd "[mcname]"
mc "..."
kd "Hey. Weirdo."
mc "... Huh?"

--UTC night--

kd "..."
mc "?! K-Kendrick?!"
"I took a few steps back on instinct. He was the last person I expected to run into here."
"Kendrick must have noticed my intent to run, as his expression soon became fairly dejected." 
kd "Are you going to leave again...?"
mc "Ngh..."
"I couldn't help but wince at that."
mc “I-I.."
kd "..."
"After a moment's hesitation, he let out a sigh."
kd "[mcname]."
mc "Y-Yes...?"
kd “Please, forget I said anything.”
mc “!!”
mc "W-wait... what?"
kd "It's obvious my feelings have done nothing but hinder you."
kd "Objectively speaking, I feel it's best if things end here."
mc "..."
kd "..."
kd "Thank you, and goodbye, [mcname]."
"Before I could completely process what was happening, he turned on his heel to leave.”
"I stood there in utter disbelief just watching his back.”
mc "..."
mc "(What... What do I do...?)"
"My hands tightened into fists. My heart began to race."
mc "(Are things really just going to end?"
mc "W... Wait...!"
mc “(My legs abruptly moves on its own.)"
mc “WAIIIIT!”
"I run to him at full speed, quickly running out of breath.)”
mc “(Desperate with countless things I want to say to him running through my mind, I trip over my own two feet.)
"Lucky for me, Kendrick had turned, and caught in time."
mc “(This is my first time being this close to him.)”
mc “(He’s so big, he’s so warm...)”
“(Maybe it's because of being carried like a princess by Kendrick, or the trauma from the accident that almost occurred, but I don't remember why I turned around.)”
mc “Uh, hi..”
kd “[mcname]. Don't ever put yourself in danger like that again.”
mc “Can you put me down?”
kd “Oh, yeah, sorry.”
“(After he puts me down, I stumble a bit, but I manage catch my breath and regain composure.)”
kd "You're kind of light."
"Trying to ignore his comment with a furiously blushing face, I remember what I have to do."
mc “Look, I’m going to be honest, I think you’re a pretentious, annoying, pedantic butt hole.”
"My emotionally charged words come out like a waterfall."
kd “I see.”
"I'm taken aback by his docileness. I expected him to cut me with even harsher words."
"Kendrick stoically bears the full brunt of my feelings, accepting every last word I have to give him."
mc “I still kind of believe that sometimes.”
"Kendrick's stoic visage remains, but I can see the specks of sadness leaking through his features."
"Spurred by my admiration of his moment of willing vulnerability, I push myself to continue speaking unabatedly."
"Fortunately, my next honest words are ones of praise and affection."
mc "But it turns out, I kinda like your rough edges."
mc "Underneath that harsh exterior is a kind, sweet, hardworking person."
mc "I think the contrast between your different sides is really... adorable."
mc “(Oh lord, now I’m getting embarrassed.”)
mc “S-so, yeah, I’ll go out with you, I-if you're okay with me.”
"Kendrick smiles wrly."
kd “I'm not sure that dating a loud, impulsive, wide-eyed girl would be the best decision for me in the long run.”
mc "How dare you? After I dumped all of my hidden feelings right in front of you!"
"I know Kendrick is joking and just paying me back for my insults, but I can't help but feel somewhat exasperated, so I begin to stomp away."
"Kendrick grabs onto my shoulders to stop me from leaving and twirls me around to face his very close face."
kd "But I can't help but love that about you."
#fade to black
"He leans in and we share we share the most special moment of the quarter together."

[BAD ENDING]


--black--

"I never did get the courage to respond to his confession."
"With time, we just became more and more distant."
“Months after we finished the project, I quit VGDC and found a whole new group of friends.”
“Sometimes I still see my old VGDC friends on Facebook, but we don't interact much outside of liking each others' posts.”

--coffe shop--

“I’ve just picked up my coffee when all of a sudden I hear a familiar voice..”
kd “Excuse me.”
mc “S-sure.”
“It’s Kendrick. I wonder if he recognizes me.”
kd “Is there a problem?”
mc “(Oh crud, he noticed me staring.)”
mc “N-nothing.”
kd “Alright.”
“I let out a sigh, hoping I don’t have to go through that again."
mc "(Meeting people you weren’t supposed to ever see again is weird, isn’t it?)”
mc “(Whatever, I'm going to be alright.)”
