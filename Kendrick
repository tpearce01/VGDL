[INITIAL STRUGGLE]

>Protag chooses to join Production department because she’s passionate about video game development and has a game she really wants to produce
--SSLH--
mc "(Production, huh...)"
mc "Hmmm..."
"As Jeorge Dan resumed his presentation, I considered the appeal of joining the productions department."
mc "(The other departments are interesting, but it'd be nice to get some leadership experience.)"
mc "(That, and I've always wanted to lead a game of my own...)"
"Since I could remember, I've been making up video games in my head, some more complex than others."
"I'd always wanted to bring at least one of those ideas to life, but never had the resources to do so."
"That is, until now."
mc "(But... should I?)"
mc "...."
mc "..."
mc ".."
mc "(Ah, well. What have I got to lose, right?)"
mc "(This is my first quarter here in UCI. Let's hit the ground running!)"
"Just as I'd come to a conclusion, the room errupted in applause."
"People started getting up and Jeorge Dan began tidying the podium."
mc "(Looks like the meeting's over.)"
"I got up from my chair and merged into the sea of fleeing college students and started mulling over my game."
mc "(Alright, my first project shouldn't be too ambitious.)"
mc "(Now to think of something simple and entertaining...)"

>Pitches project. Complex format, but really well done and thought out.
--Outside SSLH--
mc "Talk about submitting pitch and go into game and be really determined"
mc “(The time comes to pitch my game, the more people are called to share they’re game ideas, the more that my nervousness grows.)”
mc “(Dang, I can’t even pay attention to other people’s presentations, I’m so nervous.)”
mc “(Finally the dreaded moment arrives and my name is called.)
mc “(I sat kinda far away from the stage, so I start kinda running.)
mc “(Oh god, they’re giggling at my run, this is already a huge failure.)
mc “(No time to think about that, I jump on stage and catch my breath.)
mc “Helloooooooooo VGDC!”
mc “(Oh good, they’re laughing. This gives me the confidence to push forward.)"
mc “I’m a first year, my major is not important, and my game idea is a platformer called T-rex Attack!”
mc “(I commit myself to a little pose, holding my arms and bending my wrists like a T-rex. The audience laughs.)
mc “So in my game, the asteroids hit, and they decide to give space weapons to the evil vegetarian dinosaurs so they can get revenge on the cute and innocent carnivorous ones.”
mc “You play as a T-rex, your family was killed by the evil vegetarians, and you want to join the resistance.”
mc “Only problem is, you’re a T-rex, and your arms are tiny as heck.”
mc “So as the game progresses, you take their weapons and use them as your own, getting stronger.”
jd “Okay, ten seconds.”
mc “Oh, um okay, and uh, yeah.”
"I forgot there was a time limit."
mc “(I don’t know why I was even nervous. This is fun, the people here are nice!)
mc “So yeah, I’m [mcname] and my game is T-rex Attack!”
"I do the T-rex pose again."
mc "Thank you all for listening!”

>Teams formulated. Kendrick is the officer buddy of the group.
--Black--
"Narration to indicate time skip"
--Inside SSLH--
mc "(Omg my team is so hhootttt)"

>Kendrick is detached and blunt. Recognizes the potential of the game but not the protag herself.
kd “Now that the roles have been assigned it’s time to hit the ground running. I’ll be here if you need help.”
“Kendrick looks determined, maybe he really liked my game idea. I’m feeling good about this, I have to be enthusiastic too.”
mc “I’m hyped! I promise that I’m going to produce the heck out of this!”
“I put my hands on my hips and puff my chest out proudly."
"Seeing everyone smile makes me believe that they're caught in my pace, except... Kendrick."
"Like a troublesome zit staining the nearly flawless sea of faces of my team, he's glowering at me with a disgruntled expression."
mc “B-but remember guys, the most important thing is to h-have fun.”
"I unintentionally stutter as his piercing glare cracks my confidence.
kd “I don’t know if you’re aware of this, but VGDC is a serious club.”
mc “I know, bu-”
kd “For god's sake, the people in our organization have gone on to work at the greatest companies the gaming industry has to offer, this isn’t a happy go lucky lets make friends and play patty cake baby club, if that’s what you were expecting, you should leave”
mc "(Oh my god, what's his problem? I didn’t even say anything.)"
mc "(Maybe this is a comedy bit? Maybe he thinks he’s being funny by being a douchebag?)”
mc “Psshh, alright.”
“I look at my fellow club members and motion to Kendrick”
mc “can you believe this guy? Whats up his butt?”
“nobody is laughing, I’m starting to figure out that this isn’t a comedy thing. Oh god think I’ve made this already uncomfortable situation worse”
kd “get out”
mc “I-I'm sorry, I thought we were doing a bit.”
kd “A bit?”
mc “L-like you were joking”
kd “Why would I be joking?”
mc “C-cause you were being super serious, I-I thought you were trying to scare us.”
kd “I never joke. You might think that your game, and probably your life, is a joke, but I’m actually trying to get things done.”
“He didn’t have to bring my life into this, although, I guess he’s technically right.”
"But he could have put it in a bit nicer way..."
mc “My bad, I just misread the situation. I’m sorry.”
kd “It's fine. Just don’t make the mistake again, get to producing, we meet here next week at the same time. Dismissed.”
mc “(I already hate college, I knew I should have gone to UC Riverside.)”

>Team disbands. Protag talks to Kendrick alone to ask what she should be doing/his thoughts
mc "So uh do you wanna touch dicks"

>Speaks really harshly and bluntly. Unintentionally an asshole, that’s just how he is. Protag sees him as someone hard to get along with but doesn’t hate him (yet).
mc "(Monologue about how she'll ganbate despite it all)"

>Gets a Discord up. Starts things up, but Kendrick makes a scene
--MC room--
mc "(Yaaay time to talk on discord!)
--Phone thing--
mc “(I got everyone’s phone number and email at the meeting, I figured it would be best to set up a Discord and contact everyone online.)”
mc “(All the invitations had been sent in class, now I just had to wait for everyone to join.)”
mc “(Once everyone joined, I figured I would get the ball rolling, try to get everyone to introduce themselves, that whole bit.)”
mc “(I’ve always been better at online conversation anyways, they can think I suck in real life, but online, maybe they can at the very least tolerate me.)”
mc “Alright guys, thank you so much for joining my game crew, I figured it would be fun to introduce ourselves, so let's start with your year, major, and a fun fact about yourself.”
mc “(Nobody is typing, so I guess I'll have to get started.)”
mc “My name is [mcname], I’m a first year, my major is undecided, and I was really into dinosaurs when I was a kid."
mc "Other girls wanted to be princesses, but I wanted to be T-rex.”
kd “Nobody cares, we should've made a Slack, people get way too distracted on Discord.”
“I decided to post a picture of a sad cat, with the text, “I’m sorry.””
kd “You’re posting memes? Please quit.”
mc “(Does this guy hate me personally or something, did I do something to him in the past that I don’t remember?)”
mc “Are you okay?”
kd “Fantastic, I’m just frustrated that every year, I get assigned groups led by children who don’t understand the responsibilities that come with leading a video game development team.”
mc “Dude, I don’t think I’ve even done anything to make you think that I’m not capable of leading this team.”
mc "Making this game has been my dream since I was eight."
kd “Then why haven’t you made it yet?”
mc “I don’t know how to make games, which is why I joined this club.”
kd “You like to daydream and think about all the cool things that you would someday do, but the day never comes, I’m sick of having to be assigned people like you.”
mc “Man, that cuts deep, he’s right though, I always have these fad dreams that never actually pan out, doing karate, becoming a singer, getting into UCLA.”
mc “(Who’s to say that this game won’t just be another thrown away dream in my sea of unfulfilled dreams, I mean all the evidence up until now shows that its the most likely outcome.)”
mc “(Damn, I’m tearing up, its moments like these that make me glad to be online and not in person.)”
mc “(I really am a failure, I’m always going to be a failure.)”
mc “(Wait, no..!)”
mc “(Didn’t I tell myself I was going to change, I’m at a new school, its time for a fresh start, and it starts now!)”
mc “(Besides, who does this guy think he is? He doesn’t know me? For all he knows I could be a genius programmer, a fisherman, a ski instructor...)”
mc “(This guy hasn’t even known me for a whole day and already thinks he has me pinned down?)”
mc “(If I don’t change for myself, I’m going to change out of spite, to prove this pretentious freak wrong!)”
mc “(I’m going to play it cool, I’m happy again that I’m online and can pretend.)”
mc “Just calm down and get some sleep, Kendrick. It’s true that I don’t have experience making games, but I got pretty good grades and held leadership roles in high school."
mc "I’m sorry about your past experiences, but I can assure you that this is not the case.”
kd “We’ll see...”
“He goes offline.”

>Ok now she low key hates him
--mc room--
mc "Wow upsetti spaghetti"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[Wow Heck you Kendrick]]

#tm stands for team member


>Week time skip of low-key hatred. 
mc “(Kendrick is getting on my nerves. Everyday, he always does something that infuriates me.”
mc “(Yesterday he dropped his pencil, and he just pointed at me and the pencil like he was entitled to me bending over to pick it up for him.”
mc “(How do people this rude even fit into society?)”

>Now Kendrick starts being mean to the rest of the team, and protag blows up
kd “No, this is garbage, do it again.”
tm ”O-okay, what about it do you want me to fix?”
mc “It’s mostly fine, just maybe color inside the lines a little more.”
kd “Don’t listen to her, its wrong do it again”
mc “What part?”
kd “All of it, redo it.”

>Details how he’s such an asshat, but Kendrick doesn’t understand. mc “I feel like you wake up, come in here and think..”
#imitating Kendrick
mc “Hmmm what should I be mad about today, oh I know, I’m going to be a giant pedantic poop hole to my club members”
kd “Poop hole?”
mc “I’m not censoring myself because VGDC doesn’t allow bad words."
mc "I’m talking about your mouth, insinuating that what comes out of it is pure poop, it's poetic.”
kd “I don’t see why you’re so mad. The art is garbage, the drawing is chicken scratch, the coloring goes out of the lines."
kd "It's unoriginal and uninspired. I could go on, but for the sake of time, I felt that “it's garbage” would suffice.”
mc “Okay, first of all, it's not even that bad. Second of all, you could have shown him what he’s doing right and what he could improve on."
mc "How is he going to get better if all you can do is say “it's garbage” and denounce the drawing he worked hard on?”
kd “I told you, this is a serious club. I’m not here to hold your hands and nurture you from my teet like a little baby."
kd "You are all grown adults and are expected to behave as such.”
mc “You keep going on about serious this club is and this and that, but I’ve spoken to the other teams."
mc "All of them have nothing but nice things to say about their officer buddies, so it's really just you.”
kd “It's usually just me taking work seriously, that’s why I was one of the only ones who has had internships at Binbendo."
kd "You think this type of art and behavior in general is going to pass at a legit workspace where making games is what puts food on the table?”
mc “This is a club, not a full time job, so making this video game isn’t life or death for me.”
kd “It is for me.”

>Kendrick leaves at protag’s request. Meeting continues. 
mc “Well then I think you should go and find more people who are willing to put up with your crap.”
kd “Is that what you all think?”
mc “(Everyone looks at each other, one person starts nodding, everybody nods.)”
kd “Alright, I will take my leave, hopefully the next team I get won’t be filled with bumbling buffoons.”
mc “Oh yeah, I’m sure they’d love to have you. That was sarcastic by the way.”“I’m just stating the truth.”

>Protag asks president if she could switch officer buddies. JD smiles and says he’ll do what he can.
"messages between the two"

> JD asks Protag to come to the game lab late at night when no one’s there. Surprise! Kendrick’s there. 
cc “(Alright, I texted JD and was told to wait here in the game lab, I mean I know Irvine is one of the safest cities ever, but walking around campus at night is still kinda spooky.)”
“I arrive at the game room."
"To my surprise, Kendrick is there, I try to turn around and leave, but the president is blocking the door."
"Right before I can stick my fingers through the gap, he speaks a single sentence.”

> “Make nice kiddos” Exit JD
jd “Make nice kiddos.”
“And he shuts the door.”
“A couple seconds of silence pass, feeling like minutes.”

> Kendrick starts off. “I don’t see what the issue is here. Why didnt you just communicate with me?”
“Kendrick breaks the silence.”
kd “I don’t see what the issue is here. Why didn’t you just communicate with me?”

>Protag passive aggressively responds. 
mc “Why would I bother even trying when the answer would be “it's garbage” anyways?

>Kendrick low-key irritated. Protag scoffs and leaves.
kd “That’s rich, ming from someone who would just respond by mockingly imitating them.”
mc “Well, it'sbvious that neither of us are particularly enjoying this situation, so how about we just agree to interact as little as possible until the end, then I can quit the club and we can never see each other again.”
kd “Deal.”
“A Couple seconds of silence pass.”
mc “I really wish prez didn’t lock the door, this is weird.”
kd “I don’t want to be in here either.”
mc “Let me check if the window is open.”
kd “Don’t you open up that window.”
mc “Don’t you let out that antidote!”
kd “What?”
mc “You listen to Travis Scott?”
kd “What’s that?”
mc “Never mind, I almost thought you were kinda cool.”
“I jump out the window.”

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[Kendrick realizes people have feelings]


>Kendrick POV. Confused with Protag’s declarations but seriously analyzes her words
kd “(I hate these intrusive thoughts, like a worm stuck in my brain that I can’t get out,  I can’t even focus in school without thinking about her words)”
kd “(Usually I dismiss it as stupid people saying stupid people things, but maybe.)”
kd “(I even listened to that song, kinda liked it, but ill never tell her that, she’ll never let it go.)”
kd “(And that imitation, the sound is completely wrong, but the mannerisms and tone are pretty close.)”

>Back to protag. Next meeting. Kendrick is there super early.
mc “(I shows up, Kendrick is already there.)”
mc “What’s up K DOT!”
kd “What?”
mc “Listen to more hip hop.”

>Protag is low key snarky. Kendrick doesnt respond as usual and protag is a little surprised.
tm "members doing shit"

>Meeting goes on. Kendrick is still mean but catches himself and reiterates often. The whole team is surprised.
"Narration of the things"

>Something happens where Kendrick ends up apologizing to the protag and she’s just so flabbergasted she takes him outside
mc “(He stopped himself?)”
kd “You’re right, I’m sorry.”
mc “(What the heck, he never apologizes, is he alright?)”
mc “Can you step outside with me outside?”
kd “Sure.”
mc “(We stand outside the game room)”

>”Yo art thou okay.”
mc “Yo fam, are you dying? Do you have cancer?”
kd “No, doctor says I’m in peak physical condition”
mc “Err, okay….”
kd “I’ve decided cooperating with you would be most beneficial to me. Nothing more.”
mc “Hmmmmm, okay, okay, I see you, I see you.”

>Protag is impressed and is expresses her happiness. Kendrick doesn’t understand.
kd “Is there something wrong with that?”
mc “Nah nah, quite the opposite actually, here’s some candy, as a reward, and also for positive reinforcement.”
kd “what am I, a dog?”
mc “That would be an insult to dogs”
kd “Whatever.”
mc “Kendrick eats it, he puts the wrapper in his pocket.”
mc “Alright boy, lets get to work.”

>Some cheesy line about how shes proud or something idk
mc "Uwaaaa sugoi desuuu"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[Kendrick feels affection.]


> Weeks pass. Kendrick gradually becomes more and more a decent person
>Officers notices, especially JD (because he’s cool like that)
>Something happens where Kendrick becomes super duper stressed. Protag notices. She expresses concern but Kendrick pushes her away.
>Another meeting. Kendrick falls asleep but protag doesn't want anyone to wake him up
>Everyone leaves and it’s just him and her. He asks why she just let him sleep and she goes on about how he should take care of himself more and how great he’s doing and how impressed/proud she is of him
> Kendrick’s kawaii kokoro goes doki doki. Protag leaves.
> Kendrick POV something gushy and gross about woa protag is such a sweetie.
>They keep meeting up in the game lab and he gets all flustered and jealous whenever she’s happy with other guys
>Low key tsundere. Protag thinks he’s cute.
> “... Hold on. Did I actually just think that”

5. Kendrick confesses. Protag recognizes her feelings for him.
>Another time skip. Monologue about how Kendrick’s pretty dang chill.
>All of a sudden…
> “I like you. Please go out with me.”
> “Nani the fukk”
> Protag thinks she’s dreaming, but nope, it’s reality.
>Starts freaking out. Super flustered. She never considered her feelings to be like that

Phuoc help me choose how the good ending would go:
1. Kendrick sees how Protag has difficulty talking to him and asks her to forget he ever confessed. This pushes protag to confess to him and they go out
2. Kendrick is super chivalrous manly man who supports protag with her project and she’s so grateful and emotional with how kind he is she gives a super cheesy and embarrassed and shy confession and he teases her and wow this is disgustingly sweet

ALT. BAD END
>They never feel for one another. They becomes strangers once more after the project ends.

~~~~~


(Weeks pass, Kendrick gradually becomes more and more of a decent person)


mc “(The President is talking to me, outside of Starbucks.)”
jd “Alright, what did you do?”
mc “What?”
jd “who is this new Kendrick, and what have you done to the old one”
mc “again, what?”
jd “Kendrick! Ever since he started in your guy’s group he’s been, err, nicer, well meaning, laughing, just all around better human being!”
mc “really?”
jd “I even caught him listening to hip hop yesterday, every time I used to play it around him he would make me switch songs!”
mc “Huh, I guess, I don’t really know what caused it though.”
jd “Well, I don’t know what you guys are doing, but keep doing it, oops I got class, see ya late.r”
mc “Bye bye!”

(back to the game room)

mc “Yo”
kd “Sup”
mc “Dang, he says sup now?! Maybe he has changed.  I won’t say anything though.”
“Moments pass, and Kendrick looks at his phone, his eyes widen, he stands up.”
mc “Everything alright.”
kd “Uh, yea, sorry, its alright, its alright.”
mc “Seriously dude, are you okay?”
kd “Its fine alright, its just, its nothing.”
mc “(He walks out the door.)”
mc “(Next meeting, a week later...)”
mc “Sup.”
kd “*yawns*”
kd “Yo.”
mc “You tired?”
kd “A little, but I’ll be alright.”
mc “Hmm?”
mc “(like half an hour passes and Kendrick falls asleep)”
kd “*Snores*”
mc “Heh.”
mc “Don’t wake him up guys, he’s tired.”
mc “(Time passes, the meeting ends, everyone but Kendrick and I goes home, its just the two of us now...)”
kd “*yawns*”
mc “did you have a good rest?”
kd “Oh crap, where am, MY WORK!”
mc “Don’t worry about it, I made Alonso do it, he never does anything anyways.”
kd “Why didn’t you wake me up?”
mc “Dude, you’re internship, your job, school, whatever that message was the other day, your pretty stressed aren’t you?”
kd “Don’t worry about it, I’m doing great in all of those things.”
mc “I don’t care about those things, I mean I’m happy and proud of you and all that, but I care about you, you don’t need to tell me what’s going on, but please get some rest and don’t burn out alright?”
mc “Kendrick blushes, stronger this time.”
kd “d-d-don’t worry about it!”
mc “hmm, alright.”
mc “(I pick up my bag and just as I’m going to open the door I hear.)”
kd “MC?”
mc “Whatsup?”
kd “T-thanks.”
mc “(Heh, that was kinda cute.)”
mc “Wait what the heck, did that thought actually just cross my mind?”
mc “A-anytime fam.”
mc “(I smile and take my leave.)”

(Kendrick’s inner thoughts before the next club meeting, he’s holding the old wrapper from the piece of candy she gave him.)

kd “(Mc looked pretty cute last week, I wonder what she’s gona wear today?)”
kd “(Yesterday she wore jeans, an anime shirt, and sneakers,  looked kinda boyish, but cute.)”
kd “(I like how she knows all the bands and tv shows on her t shirts, a lot of people buy shirts just because they like the look, but she actually knows what they’re about.)”
kd “(I really like her round yellow glasses too, I wish she wore them more.)”
kd “(And her messy dark hair.)”
kd “(AAAAGHGHH WHAT THE HECK AM I THINKING!)”
kd “(Jesus, I even listened to that god awful lil whatever album just because I wanted something to talk to her!)”
kd “(Whats happening to me?)”
mc “Yo whats popping dudes!”
kd “(Dang, why did I hesitate to I say hi? now she’s talking to that useless dude again.)”
kd “(What are they talking about, why are they laughing so much?)”
mc “Alright, see you at the show!”
kd “Show, what show?”
mc “Oh, we were gona go see the Lil pump show, I was gona invite you but you would probably say its garbage anyways, though in this case I would probably agree with you haha!”
kd “What, no I don’t care, do what you want.”
mc “LMAO dude do you wanna go?”
kd “NO!”
mc “I bet you secretly do want to go, did you listen to the new album?”
kd “A-absolutely not, why would I listen to that garbage, he just repeats “Gucci gang” like a hundred times!”
mc “You DID listen to the album HAHAHA”
mc “(I’m hitting the table and pointing at him)”
kd “S-shut up, I didn’t listen to it because of you, I-I just happen to have clicked on it and was to lazy to change it, that’s all.”
mc “(Alright, I had my fill.)”
mc “Sorry man, I’m just teasing you.”
kd “Get to work.”

(back to mc thoughts) 

mc “(Dang, I can’t believe he actually listened to it, it was kinda cute to watch him deny it so vehemently.)”
mc “(Wait, wait wait wait, did I just think he was cute, AGAIN?)”


(Kendrick’s confession)


mc “(A couple of weeks have passed, and Kendrick has actually gotten super chill.)”
mc “(Well, not chill by normal human standards, but compared to the huge pedantic butthole that he was when we met him....)”
mc “(Its 1 am, he told me to meet him outside SSLH 100, I think its to turn in some hand drawn art, we’re approaching the deadline so we’re in overtime.)”
mc “(I borrow my room mate’s scooter, and head out.)”
mc “(I scoot for a bit, see some dance crews practicing,)”
mc ”(can’t believe dance crews practice at this hour)”
mc “(I arrive and see him sitting down against the building, his dark silhouette contrasting with the building lights)”
mc “Yo whats with the dramatic setting my man”
kd “….”
mc “Either you want me to take a picture for a mixtape cover, or you’re going to confess to me hahaha”
kd “….”
mc “Wait your actually making an mixtape?”
kd “What? NO, t-the second thing...”
kd “...”
mc “Wait, are you serious?”
kd “l-look, I like you, for real”
mc “Like for real?”
kd “Nani the fukk?”
kd “For real, please go out with me.”
mc “(Suddenly, the setting makes a lot of sense.)”
mc “(Am I dreaming, this doesn’t even feel real.)”
mc “(This is NOT a dream...)”
mc “(This is a real thing, that is happening to me, right now.)”
mc “Uuuuuhhhhhh...”


(good ending)


mc “I-I don’t know dude.”
kd “Look, I know. Its just, look, I’ve never met anyone as sweet and cute and as funny as you, and when you gave me that chocolate, I was actually, well I was going through some stuff, and your kindness, your laughter, you have no idea how much I needed it. You don’t have to like me back, or say yes, or anything, but these thoughts are keeping me up at night, and I just, I just had to tell you..”
mc “Well, I uh.”
kd “You know what, forget I said anything.”
mc “Yeah.”
mc “(I get on my scooter and leave.)”
mc “(I look back and see Kendrick’s shadow.)”
mc “(I turn around, I don’t have the words to describe why, I, I just do.)”
mc “(My body is moving on its own, hehe.)”
mc “WAIIIIT!”
kd “!!!!”
mc “(I’m scooting back at full speed, I’m almost out of breath.)”
mc “(Oh dang, too fast, I trip.)
mc “(Kendrick catches me, this is my first time being this close to him.)”
mc “(He’s so big, he’s so warm...)”
mc “(Oh man.. wait, what was I doing again? oh right!)”
mc “Uh, yo, hehehe..”
kd “Sup, haha, ha.”
mc “Can you put me down?”
kd “Oh, yea, yeah, sorry, sorry.”
mc “(He puts me down, I stumble a bit, catch my breath, regain composure, I know what I have to do.)”
mc “Look, I’m going to be honest, think you’re a pretentious, annoying, pedantic butt hole.”
kd “O-oh.”
mc “(LOL, he’s so sad, I’m enjoying this too much.)
mc “That’s what I used to think anyways.”
mc “(Look at how he widened his eyes omg, he’s like a puppy.)”
mc “Now, I think you’re not the worst person in the world, your kind, kinda sweet, hard working...”
mc “(Oh lord, now I’m getting embarrassed.”)
mc “S-so, yea, I’ll go out with you, I-if your okay with me.”
kd “I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
mc “(Its kinda quiet now, I don’t really know where to go from here, do we go home? Oh, I know, date ideas!)”
mc “So you wanna go see Lil Pump next week?”
kd “Please don’t kill my vibe.”


(bad end)


mc “(We finished the project, afterwords I switched my major, quit VGDC, now I have a whole new group of friends, and people I hang with.)”
mc “(Sometimes I still see my old VGDC friends on Facebook, but other than liking they’re posts, we aren’t really interacting)”
mc “(I’ve just picked up my free coffee at Starbucks, and I’m putting sugar and crap into it, when all of a sudden I hear a familiar voice..)”
kd “Excuse me.”
mc “S-sure.”
mc “(It’s Kendrick, the butthole from my game club!)
mc “(I wonder if he recognizes me.)”
kd “Is there a problem?”
mc “Oh crap, he noticed me staring.”
mc “N-nah fam.”
kd “Alright.”
mc “(I let out a breath, I hope I don’t have to go through that again. Meeting people you weren’t supposed to ever see again at Starbucks is weird, isn’t it?)”
mc “(Whatever, we gon be alright.)”
