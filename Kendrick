mc "(Production, huh...)"
mc "Hmmm..."
"As Jeorge Dan resumed his presentation, I considered the appeal of joining the productions department."
mc "(The other departments are interesting, but it'd be nice to get some leadership experience.)"
mc "(That, and I've always wanted to lead a game of my own...)"
"Since I could remember, I've been making up video games in my head, some more complex than others."
"I'd always wanted to bring at least one of those ideas to life, but never had the resources to do so."
"That is, until now."
mc "(But... should I?)"
mc "...."
mc "..."
mc ".."
mc "(Ah, well. What have I got to lose, right?)"
mc "(This is my first quarter here in UCI. Let's hit the ground running!)"
"Just as I'd come to a conclusion, the room errupted in applause."
"People started getting up and Jeorge Dan began tidying the podium."
mc "(Looks like the meeting's over.)"
"I got up from my chair and merged into the sea of fleeing college students and started mulling over my game."
mc "(Alright, my first project shouldn't be too ambitious.)"
mc "(Now to think of something simple and entertaining...)"

--Outside SSLH--

"A week later. Day of the game pitches."
mc "(Inhale.)"
mc "(Exhale.)"
mc "(Alright. I'm good... I'm alright!)"
mc "(I totally didn't arrive at the club meeting hall hours early out of anxiety or anything, nope. I'm just super responsible.)"
"I sighed and looked up to the sky. The sun was still out; I had a long way to go until the meeting starts."
mc "(Well... Might as well go over my pitch a few times, right?")
mc "(First, I introduce the game...)"
"The game I'd decided on creating was something I came up with as a child."
"It's called 'Tyrannosaurus Wreck!'"
"The game is a platformer with a comedic storyline. I chose this idea for its charm and simple mechanics."
"To summarize, the game takes place during prehistoric times. Asteroids hit the earth, but instead of killing the dinosaurs, they crack open to reveal weapons."
"Brutish vegetarian dinosaurs monopolize the weapons, and begin to raid small, adorable, carniverous dinosaurs."
“The protagonist of the story is a T-rex whose adoptive family is held captive by the evil vegetarians."
"Being a T-rex, they can't exactly wield weapons very well, what with their tiny arms. So, the player destroys the weapons to defeat enemies."
"The goal of the game is to destroy all weapons and rescue the family."
mc "(It'll be a quarter-long project... all skills and experience levels welcome... aaaaand, yea. That should be it.)"
"I took another deep breath."
mc "(Alright. I'll be fine. I'll be good.)"
mc "(The team will be dedicated yet comfortable, we'll get along great, and I won't regret a thing.)"
mc "(...)
mc "(...Hopefully.)"

--Black--

"In the end, my pitch went on without a hitch."
mc "(The crowd seemed to take interest, so I'm off with a good start."
"Encouraged by these thoughts, I finished off the rest of the week strong."

--Inside SSLH--

"The following meeting, day of our team assignments."
"My team gathered around our officer buddy, Kendrick."
mc "(So we got the productions officer, huh? He seemes rough around the edges, but reliable none the less.)
kd "All of you are members for the team 'Tyrannosaurus Wreck' correct?”
"We all nodded."
kd "Very well then. My name is Kendrick, and I will be aiding you all in your efforts to develop this game."
kd "If you need any assistance with anything, know that I, along with your team lead, will always be available."
"He met everyone's gaze as he spoke. He sounded sincere and determined, and I couldn't help but be impressed."
mc “(I thought he'd be a little harder to warm up to, but it looks like I was wrong. What a pleasant surprise!)" 
kd "With that said, I will now allow [mcname] to take over."
"He turned to me and gave me a nod, to which I returned."
mc "(I’m feeling good about this, I have to be enthusiastic!)"
mc "(Let's start off with a brief introduction, then I'll get everyone's contact information.)"
mc "Hello everyone! I'm [mcname], and I'm the team lead for this project."
mc "Words can not express how stoked I am to have you all on my team. Thank you all for your interest, it really means a lot!"
mc "To start off, let's have everyone join the Discordance server, then write down your contact information."

--transition to indicate time skip--

mc "Phew..."
"The meeting had come to a conclusion, and my team had disbanded for the day."
"I had talked for quite a bit. Only a few more people remained in the meeting room."
"Whilst surveying the area, I caught sight of Kendrick gathering his belongings."
mc "(Hmmm... Would he mind if I spoke to him?)"
"Aside from introducing himself at the beginning, he hadn't spoken a word during our little meeting."
mc "(I'd really like some advice from him...)"
"After a moment of contemplation, I decided to approach him."
mc "(He's my officer buddy, after all. I should be comfortable with him.)"
mc "Umm... Excuse me, Kendrick?"
kd "..."
"His eyes snapped up to me, making me stop in my tracks."
"Unlike earlier, his gaze was much colder, and I found it difficult to speak up."
mc "Umm..."
kd "Well? Speak up."
mc "gulp."
mc "Err, I-I just wanted see if you had any... uh... a-advice?"
"I unintentionally stutter as his piercing glare cracked my confidence. Kendrick sighed in response."
kd “I don’t know if you’re aware of this, but many elements must come together harmoniously when developing a platformer game.”
kd "Communicating with all your teammates and scheduling properly for a quarter project is no easy task."
mc “I... understand."
"Kendrick raised an eyebrow."
kd "Do you? Your demeanor during today's meeting told me otherwise."
mc "My demeanor? What do you mean?"
kd "You were far too colloquial. You did not establish yourself as a reliable leader figure."
mc "(...? The heck?)"
mc "Umm... Although I understand where you're getting at, don't you think you're taking this way too seriously?"
mc "My game is short, sweet, and fun. What more... this is just a club, isn't it?"
"I could see Kendrick twitch at my comment, and he intensified his glar."
kd "Treat something as though it were a joke, and your product will be become just that."
kd “I, for one, never joke. Unlike you, I’m actually trying to get things done, so I hope you'll be understanding of my actions and position."
kd "All my projects thus far have been a success. You could gain from learning a thing or two from me."
mc "Ngh..."
"I wanted to talk back, but I held my breath."
"That, and although he was disrespectful, this kind of outlook could only be beneficial to the game's development."
"I took a deep breath."
mc "(He... just wants the best for the game. For our team.)"
"I told this to myself, effectively calming me down."
mc “I understand. You are entirely correct. I appologize for what I said.”
kd "... Hmph.”
"He finished packing his things and put on his bag."
kd "... The game in itself has potential."
mc "!!"
kd "It caters to a large audience. I have faith in the product."
"Just as he turned to leave, he looked back at me.
kd "You on the other hand, I am less than confident in."
kd "I sincerely hope you prove me wrong."
"With that, he left."
mc "..."
mc "(What... the heck was that?)"
mc "(Is the guy with me, or against me?)"
"Still reeling from Kendrick's comment, I slowly headed out of the lecure hall."
mc "(One thing's for sure, he seems like a tough guy to get along with. I hope he'll warm up to me eventually...)"

--MC room--
--Phone thing--

mc "Hmmm"
"I sat on my bed, the team's Discordance server opened on my phone."
"I've set up all the channels, and all the members have been added, but it's completely empty. No one has spoken yet."
mc "(I think I'll start things off and break the ice.)"
mc “Alright guys, thank you so much for joining my game crew! Though announcements will be handled here, feel free to chat and meet one another in the off-topic channel."
"I decided to tag on an image of a happy anime character to loosen up the atmosphere."
mc "Aaaand, send."
"To my surprise, it was Kendrick's username that started typing."
kd “A work environment should be treated as a work environment. I see no reason for allowing tomfoolery.”
mc "..."
mc "I think a bit of 'tomfoolery' would be good. Helps establish a sense of comraderie, y'know?"
kd "How absolutely disappointing."
mc “(Does this guy hate me personally or something, did I do something to him in the past that I don’t remember?)”
mc “Are you okay?”
kd “Fantastic, I’m just frustrated that every year, I get assigned groups led by children who don’t understand the responsibilities that come with leading a video game development team.”
mc “Dude, I don’t think I’ve even done anything to make you think that I’m not capable of leading this team.”
mc "Producing this game has been my dream since I was eight."
kd “Then why haven’t you made it yet?”
mc “I don’t know how to make games, which is why I joined this club.”
kd “You like to daydream and think about all the cool things that you would someday do, but the day never comes; I’m sick of having to be assigned people like you.”
mc “(...Geez, that cuts deep.)" 
mc "(He’s right that I haven't done anything until now, but there's no excusing his horrible attitude.)" 
"I click my tongue in annoyance, my mind whirring with anger."
mc “(Besides, who does this guy think he is? He doesn’t know me! For all he knows I could be a genius programmer, a fisherman, a ski instructor...)”
mc “(This guy hasn’t even known me for a whole day and already thinks he has me pinned down?)”
mc “(If I don’t change for myself, I’m going to change out of spite, to prove this pretentious freak wrong!)”
"I take a deep breath."
mc “(Alright, but let's play it cool. Nothing will come from acting on emotion...)”
mc "(Rational thoughts, [mcname], rational...)"
mc “Just calm down and get some sleep, Kendrick. It’s true that I don’t have experience making games, but I got pretty good grades and held leadership roles in high school."
mc "I’m sorry about your past experiences, but I can assure you that this is not the case.”
kd “We’ll see...”
“He goes offline.”
mc "..."
mc "(Welp. So much for breaking the ice.)"
"With my impression of Kendrick lower than ever, I pull the covers over my head and go to sleep."

#tm stands for team member


--Game room--

"We had our first real team meeting a few days after. Everyone showed up, including Kendrick."
"After setting up our Bithub, I set up a schedule for the rest of the quarter. 
"On Kendrick's recommendation, we'll be meeting up twice a week."

--black--

"..."
"It's been two weeks since then. We've had a total of five meetings."
"Kendrick showed up to each one and observed the team working."
"At every opportunity, he'd point out a flaw in my work or leadership."
"At first, I'd get irritated by it. But with time, I'd gotten used to his harsh nature."
"Every meeting, I'd just take whatever he threw at me. Because as much as I'd hate to admit it, he'd bring up some pretty valid points."
"So long as it were just me, I thought I'd be able to get through the quarter just baring it all."
"One meeting at a time."
"One insult at a time."
"It'd all work out, eventually."
"..."
"It didn't last long until I was proven wrong."

--game room--

"It was the second meeting of the week."
"Midway in, the more inexperienced of my artists approached me with their laptop in their hands."
tm "[mcname]? Can I get your input on the background for the game?"
mc "Sure! Lemme take a look at it."
"He placed the laptop in front of me." 
mc "Hmmm..."
"Although a valiant effort for a newbie artist, the backrgound was riddled with imperfections. It was clearly done by an amateur."
mc "(Still, nothing a little elbow grease can't fix.)"
"I was about to explain how to fix the piece, when the person next to me spoke up."
kd “No, this is garbage, do it again.”
mc "!! Kendrick, what the heck?!"
kd "What? It's bad. Plain and simple."
"From the corner of my eye, I could see my artist siffen and meddle with his fingers."
tm ”I-I see... Umm, what about it do you want me to fix?”
"I turned to him, and put on my most comforting smile possible."
mc “It’s mostly fine! Just maybe color inside the lines a little more.”
kd “Don’t listen to her. You're better off doing it again”
mc “What part?”
kd “All of it. Redo it completely.”
tm "U-Umm... Are you sure I can't-?"
kd "Don't make me repeat myself. Stop time and do as you're told."
mc "..."
mc "Enough is enough."
"I slam my hands on the table and stand from my seat."
mc "You wanna know something, Kendrick?"
kd "..."
"Kendrick remained in his seat; he was as calm and composed as ever, and his cold gaze never faltered as he met my own."
kd "I'm listening."
mc "It's just... It's mind boggling how you don't even realize how much of a giant, pedantic poop hole you are, and to your own club members!”
kd “Poop hole?”
mc "I’m talking about your mouth, insinuating that what comes out of it is pure poop, it's poetic.”
kd “I don’t see why you’re so mad. The art is garbage, the drawing is chicken scratch, the coloring goes out of the lines."
kd "It's unoriginal and uninspired. I could go on, but for the sake of time, I felt that “it's garbage” would suffice.”
mc “Okay, first of all, it's not even that bad. Second of all, you could have shown him what he’s doing right and what he could improve on."
mc "How is he going to get better if all you can do is say “it's garbage” and denounce the drawing he worked hard on?”
kd “I told you, this is a serious club. I’m not here to hold your hands and nurture you from my teet like a little baby."
kd "You are all grown adults and are expected to behave as such.”
mc “You keep going on about serious this club is and this and that, but I’ve spoken to the other teams."
mc "All of them have nothing but nice things to say about their officer buddies, so it's really just you.”
kd “It's usually just me taking work seriously, that’s why I was one of the only ones who has had internships at Binbendo."
kd "You think this type of art and behavior in general is going to pass at a legit workspace where making games is what puts food on the table?”
mc “This is a club, not a full time job, so making this video game isn’t life or death for me.”
kd “It is for me.”
"I clicked my tongue at him."
mc “Well then, I think you should go and find more people who are willing to put up with your bull.”
kd "..."
kd “Is that what you all think?”
mc “(Everyone looks at each other, one person starts nodding, everybody nods.)”
kd “Hmph. It seems as though my presence is but a hinderance to production."
kd "In that case, I will be taking my leave."
"Kendrick stood up, and left the game room."
"My teams' eyes were downcast; the atmosphere was evidently too tense to resume working."
mc "Hey, come on guys, perk up!"
"They all turned to me, and I smiled in turn."
mc "Come on everyone, we have no reason to act so dour. Let's end the meeting strong, yea?"

--mc room--

mc "Uuuugghh...."
"Emotionally drained, I plopped on my bed and buried my head in my pillow."
mc "(I've handled Kendrick no ploblem these past few days."
mc "(If only he could've kept his words targeted at me, I could've kept things going. Ridicule my team member, however...)"
"I bit my lip as anger began to well inside me.'
mc "Tch..."
mc "(I don't want anyone from my team to be treated with disrespect. Never.)"
mc "(There's only one way to assure this..."
--phone screen--
"I pulled up the club president's account from the VGDC Discordance server, and sent him a message."
mc "/"Excuse me, Jeorge Dan? I have a request to make./""
"I was relieved to see he started typing right away."
jd "/"Yes? What is it?/""
mc "/"I'm the project lead for Tyrannosaurus Wreck. Kendrick was assigned to us as our officer buddy, but he's been incredibly disrespectful./""
mc "/"If possible, I would like to have him replaced or removed. I can't stand to see any of my members treated to poorly./""
mc "/"Any and all help for the matter would be greatly appreciated./""
"......"
"...."
"There was a pregnant pause before Jeorge Dan began to reply."
jd "/"Understood. I'll do what I can./""
mc "(Thank goodness...)"
"I thank him, then worked for the rest of the night."

--DBH Lobby--

> JD asks Protag to come to the game lab late at night when no one’s there. Surprise! Kendrick’s there. 
"The next day..."
"I recieved a message from Jeorge Dan asking me to come to DBH late at night."
"By late, I mean super late at night."
"I was all alone, sitting in the lobby. The game room was locked and barren."
mc "What's this all about, Mr.President..?"
mc "It's freezing outside. I'd much rather be within the warm confines of my room instead of here."
"As I was grumbling to myself, I heard the door to the building open."
jd "[mcname]. Thank you for coming despite the abrupt nature of my message."
jd "Part of me was worried I called for you too late and you wouldn't show up."
mc "Yep. Same here."
jd "Heh. My apologies."
mc "So. Why did you ask for me so late?"
"Just as he was about to respond, the door began to open once more."
kd "..."
mc "Kendrick?!"
kd "Hmph... Leave it to JD to devise such a tasteless scheme."
"Jeorge Dan just smiled in response as he walked up to Kendrick, and ushered him closer to me."
"It was evident from his scowl that he'd much rather turn heel and run, but I'm sure his sense of duty mandated otherwise."
"He stood before me. The only one smiling was Jeorge Dan, either hand placed on each of our backs."
mc "..."
kd "..."
jd "..."
jd "Alright. Make nice, kiddos."
"He gave us a pat, and turned to leave."
kd "... Pardon?"
mc "Wha?! Hold up, are you just going to leave us?"
"With no intention to even turn my direction, Jeorge Dan left the building."
"And just like that, I was left alone with Kendrick."
mc "(Ngh... Dang that guy...)"
“Silence fell. It'd only been a moment, but each agonizing, awkward second felt like a minute."
kd "..."
"For better or for worse, it was Kendrick who broke the ice."
kd "We both know why JD pitted us together here, so let's cut to the chase."
kd "I've given nothing but my best effort to your project, and yet you request an officer change?"
kd "Truly, I don't understand your issue is here. Why didn’t you just communicate with me?”
mc "(Tch. If I were able to, I wouldn't have a problem with you in the first place!)"
mc “Why would I bother even trying when the answer would be “it's garbage” anyways?"
"At this, Kendrick's eye sharpened. He clicked his tongue in irritation."
kd “That’s rich, coming from someone who responded just as much immaturity as you claim I am.”
mc "Ugh..."
"I realized I was letting my anger get the best of me."
"I took a deep breath, and glared him straight in the eye."
mc "You want me to 'communicate with you'? Fine. I will."
mc "

[Kendrick realizes people have feelings]


>Kendrick POV. Confused with Protag’s declarations but seriously analyzes her words
kd “(I hate these intrusive thoughts, like a worm stuck in my brain that I can’t get out,  I can’t even focus in school without thinking about her words)”
kd “(Usually I dismiss it as stupid people saying stupid people things, but maybe.)”
kd “(I even listened to that song, kinda liked it, but ill never tell her that, she’ll never let it go.)”
kd “(And that imitation, the sound is completely wrong, but the mannerisms and tone are pretty close.)”

>Back to protag. Next meeting. Kendrick is there super early.
mc “(I shows up, Kendrick is already there.)”
mc “What’s up K DOT!”
kd “What?”
mc “Listen to more hip hop.”

>Protag is low key snarky. Kendrick doesnt respond as usual and protag is a little surprised.
tm "members doing shit"

>Meeting goes on. Kendrick is still mean but catches himself and reiterates often. The whole team is surprised.
"Narration of the things"

>Something happens where Kendrick ends up apologizing to the protag and she’s just so flabbergasted she takes him outside
mc “(He stopped himself?)”
kd “You’re right, I’m sorry.”
mc “(What the heck, he never apologizes, is he alright?)”
mc “Can you step outside with me outside?”
kd “Sure.”
mc “(We stand outside the game room)”

>”Yo art thou okay.”
mc “Yo fam, are you dying? Do you have cancer?”
kd “No, doctor says I’m in peak physical condition”
mc “Err, okay….”
kd “I’ve decided cooperating with you would be most beneficial to me. Nothing more.”
mc “Hmmmmm, okay, okay, I see you, I see you.”

>Protag is impressed and is expresses her happiness. Kendrick doesn’t understand.
kd “Is there something wrong with that?”
mc “Nah nah, quite the opposite actually, here’s some candy, as a reward, and also for positive reinforcement.”
kd “what am I, a dog?”
mc “That would be an insult to dogs”
kd “Whatever.”
mc “Kendrick eats it, he puts the wrapper in his pocket.”
mc “Alright boy, lets get to work.”

>Some cheesy line about how shes proud or something idk
mc "Uwaaaa sugoi desuuu"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[Kendrick feels affection.]


> Weeks pass. Kendrick gradually becomes more and more a decent person
"Meeting in the game room and Kendrick's being a coolio bro"

>Officers notices, especially JD (because he’s cool like that)
mc “(The President is talking to me, outside of Starbucks.)”
jd “Alright, what did you do?”
mc “What?”
jd “who is this new Kendrick, and what have you done to the old one”
mc “again, what?”
jd “Kendrick! Ever since he started in your guy’s group he’s been, err, nicer, well meaning, laughing, just all around better human being!”
mc “really?”
jd “I even caught him listening to hip hop yesterday, every time I used to play it around him he would make me switch songs!”
mc “Huh, I guess, I don’t really know what caused it though.”
jd “Well, I don’t know what you guys are doing, but keep doing it, oops I got class, see ya late.r”
mc “Bye bye!”

>Something happens where Kendrick becomes super duper stressed. Protag notices. She expresses concern but Kendrick pushes her away.
mc “Yo”
kd “Sup”
mc “Dang, he says sup now?! Maybe he has changed.  I won’t say anything though.”
“Moments pass, and Kendrick looks at his phone, his eyes widen, he stands up.”
mc “Everything alright.”
kd “Uh, yea, sorry, its alright, its alright.”
mc “Seriously dude, are you okay?”
kd “Its fine alright, its just, its nothing.”
mc “(He walks out the door.)”

>Another meeting. Kendrick falls asleep but protag doesn't want anyone to wake him up
mc “(Next meeting, a week later...)”
mc “Sup.”
kd “*yawns*”
kd “Yo.”
mc “You tired?”
kd “A little, but I’ll be alright.”
mc “Hmm?”
mc “(like half an hour passes and Kendrick falls asleep)”
kd “*Snores*”
mc “Heh.”
mc “Don’t wake him up guys, he’s tired.”

>Everyone leaves and it’s just him and her. He asks why she just let him sleep and she goes on about how he should take care of himself more and how great he’s doing and how impressed/proud she is of him
mc “(Time passes, the meeting ends, everyone but Kendrick and I goes home, its just the two of us now...)”
kd “*yawns*”
mc “did you have a good rest?”
kd “Oh crap, where am, MY WORK!”
mc “Don’t worry about it, I made Alonso do it, he never does anything anyways.”
kd “Why didn’t you wake me up?”
mc “Dude, you’re internship, your job, school, whatever that message was the other day, your pretty stressed aren’t you?”
kd “Don’t worry about it, I’m doing great in all of those things.”
mc “I don’t care about those things, I mean I’m happy and proud of you and all that, but I care about you, you don’t need to tell me what’s going on, but please get some rest and don’t burn out alright?”

> Kendrick’s kawaii kokoro goes doki doki. Protag leaves.
mc “Kendrick blushes, stronger this time.”
kd “d-d-don’t worry about it!”
mc “hmm, alright.”
mc “(I pick up my bag and just as I’m going to open the door I hear.)”
kd “MC?”
mc “Whatsup?”
kd “T-thanks.”
mc “(Heh, that was kinda cute.)”
mc “Wait what the heck, did that thought actually just cross my mind?”
mc “A-anytime fam.”
mc “(I smile and take my leave.)”

> Kendrick POV something gushy and gross about woa protag is such a sweetie.

>They keep meeting up in the game lab and he gets all flustered and jealous whenever she’s happy with other guys
kd “(Mc looked pretty cute last week, I wonder what she’s gona wear today?)”
kd “(Yesterday she wore jeans, an anime shirt, and sneakers,  looked kinda boyish, but cute.)”
kd “(I like how she knows all the bands and tv shows on her t shirts, a lot of people buy shirts just because they like the look, but she actually knows what they’re about.)”
kd “(I really like her round yellow glasses too, I wish she wore them more.)”
kd “(And her messy dark hair.)”
kd “(AAAAGHGHH WHAT THE HECK AM I THINKING!)”
kd “(Jesus, I even listened to that god awful lil whatever album just because I wanted something to talk to her!)”
kd “(Whats happening to me?)”
mc “Yo whats popping dudes!”
kd “(Dang, why did I hesitate to I say hi? now she’s talking to that useless dude again.)”
kd “(What are they talking about, why are they laughing so much?)”
mc “Alright, see you at the show!”

>Low key tsundere. Protag thinks he’s cute.
kd “Show, what show?”
mc “Oh, we were gona go see the Lil pump show, I was gona invite you but you would probably say its garbage anyways, though in this case I would probably agree with you haha!”
kd “What, no I don’t care, do what you want.”
mc “LMAO dude do you wanna go?”
kd “NO!”
mc “I bet you secretly do want to go, did you listen to the new album?”
kd “A-absolutely not, why would I listen to that garbage, he just repeats “Gucci gang” like a hundred times!”
mc “You DID listen to the album HAHAHA”
mc “(I’m hitting the table and pointing at him)”
kd “S-shut up, I didn’t listen to it because of you, I-I just happen to have clicked on it and was to lazy to change it, that’s all.”
mc “(Alright, I had my fill.)”
mc “Sorry man, I’m just teasing you.”
kd “Get to work.”

> “... Hold on. Did I actually just think that”
mc “(Dang, I can’t believe he actually listened to it, it was kinda cute to watch him deny it so vehemently.)”
mc “(Wait, wait wait wait, did I just think he was cute, AGAIN?)”

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[Kendrick confesses. Protag recognizes her feelings for him.]


>Another time skip. Game finished Monologue about how Kendrick’s pretty dang chill.
mc “(A couple of weeks have passed, and Kendrick has actually gotten super chill.)”
mc “(Well, not chill by normal human standards, but compared to the huge pedantic butthole that he was when we met him....)”

>All of a sudden…
> “I like you. Please go out with me.”
mc “(Its 1 am, he told me to meet him outside SSLH 100, I think its to turn in some hand drawn art, we’re approaching the deadline so we’re in overtime.)”
mc “(I borrow my room mate’s scooter, and head out.)”
mc “(I scoot for a bit, see some dance crews practicing,)”
mc ”(can’t believe dance crews practice at this hour)”
mc “(I arrive and see him sitting down against the building, his dark silhouette contrasting with the building lights)”
mc “Yo whats with the dramatic setting my man”
kd “….”
mc “Either you want me to take a picture for a mixtape cover, or you’re going to confess to me hahaha”
kd “….”
mc “Wait your actually making an mixtape?”
kd “What? NO, t-the second thing...”
kd “...”
mc “Wait, are you serious?”
kd “l-look, I like you, for real”

> “Nani the fukk”
mc “Like for real?”
kd “Nani the fukk?”
kd “For real, please go out with me.”

> Protag thinks she’s dreaming, but nope, it’s reality.
mc “(Suddenly, the setting makes a lot of sense.)”
mc “(Am I dreaming, this doesn’t even feel real.)”
mc “(This is NOT a dream...)”
mc “(This is a real thing, that is happening to me, right now.)”

>Starts freaking out. Super flustered. She never considered her feelings to be like that
mc “Uuuuuhhhhhh...”

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[GOOD END]


1. Kendrick sees how Protag has difficulty talking to him and asks her to forget he ever confessed. This pushes protag to confess to him and they go out


>kendrick approaches
mc “I-I don’t know.”
kd “It's just, I’ve never met anyone as sweet and cute and as funny as you, and when you gave me that chocolate, I was actually, well I was going through some stuff, and your kindness, your laughter, you have no idea how much I needed it. You don’t have to like me back, or say yes, or anything, but these thoughts are keeping me up at night, and I just, I just had to tell you..”
mc “Well, I uhh...”
kd “You know what, forget I said anything.”
mc “Yeah.”
mc “(I get on my scooter and leave.)”
mc “(I try to stop myself from looking back, but I give in and see Kendrick’s lonely shadow fading away.)”
mc “(My body abruptly turns around on its own.)"
mc “WAIIIIT!”
mc “(I’m scooting back at full speed, almost out of breath.)”
mc “(Desperate with countless things I want to say to him running through my mind, I brake too rapidly for my current speed.)
"My body flies off of my scooter and towards the hard concrete, but Kendrick manages to dash and catch me in time."
mc “(This is my first time being this close to him.)”
mc “(He’s so big, he’s so warm...)”
“(Maybe it's because of being carried like a princess by Kendrick, or the trauma from the accident that almost occurred, but I don't remember why I turned around.)”
mc “Uh, hi..”
kd “[mcname]. Don't ever put yourself in danger like that again.”
mc “Can you put me down?”
kd “Oh, yeah, sorry.”
“(After he puts me down, I stumble a bit, but I manage catch my breath and regain composure.)”
kd "You're kind of light."
"Trying to ignore his comment with a furiously blushing face, I remember what I have to do."
mc “Look, I’m going to be honest, I think you’re a pretentious, annoying, pedantic butt hole.”
"My emotionally charged words come out like a waterfall."
kd “I see.”
"I'm taken aback by his docileness. I expected him to cut me with even harsher words."
"Kendrick stoically bears the full brunt of my feelings, accepting every last word I have to give him."
mc “I still kind of believe that sometimes.”
"Kendrick's stoic visage remains, but I can see the specks of sadness leaking through his features."
"Spurred by my admiration of his moment of willing vulnerability, I push myself to continue speaking unabatedly."
"Fortunately, my next honest words are ones of praise and affection."
mc "But it turns out, I kinda like your rough edges."
mc "Underneath that harsh exterior is a kind, sweet, hardworking person."
mc "I think the contrast between your different sides is really... adorable."
mc “(Oh lord, now I’m getting embarrassed.”)
mc “S-so, yeah, I’ll go out with you, I-if you're okay with me.”
"Kendrick smiles wrly."
kd “I'm not sure that dating a loud, impulsive, wide-eyed girl would be the best decision for me in the long run.”
mc "How dare you? After I dumped all of my hidden feelings right in front of you!"
"I know Kendrick is joking and just paying me back for my insults, but I can't help but feel somewhat exasperated, so I begin to stomp away."
"Kendrick grabs onto my shoulders to stop me from leaving and twirls me around to face his very close face."
kd "But I can't help but love that about you."

mc “(After we finished the project, I switched my major, quit VGDC, and found a whole new group of friends.)”
mc “(Sometimes I still see my old VGDC friends on Facebook, but we don't interact much outside of liking each others' posts.)”
mc “(I’ve just picked up my free coffee at Starbucks, and I’m putting sugar and crap into it, when all of a sudden I hear a familiar voice..)”
kd “Excuse me.”
mc “S-sure.”
mc “(It’s Kendrick, the eyesore from my game club.)
mc “(I wonder if he recognizes me.)”
kd “Is there a problem?”
mc “(Oh crap, he noticed me staring.)”
mc “N-nothing.”
kd “Alright.”
mc “(I let out a sigh, hoping I don’t have to go through that again."
mc "(Meeting people you weren’t supposed to ever see again at Starbucks is weird, isn’t it?)”
mc “(Whatever, I'm going to be alright.)”
