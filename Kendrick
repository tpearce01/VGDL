(Scene 1)

(teams formulated. Kendrick is the officer buddy of the group)
Kd “Now that the roles have been assigned it’s time to hit the ground running. I’ll be here if you need help.”
“Kendrick looks determined, maybe he really liked my game idea. I’m feeling good about this, I gotta be enthusiastic too”
Mc “I’m hype! I promise that I’m going to produce the heck out of this, I’m ready to roll!”
“I put my hands on my hips and puff my chest out proudly, everyone seems to be excited to roll, but Kendrick looks at me with a “what the hell are you doing expression”, maybe a bit too enthusiastic?”
Mc “B-but remember guys, the most important thing is to h-have fun, hehe”
Kd “I don’t know if you’re aware of this, but VGDC is a serious club.”
Mc “h-haha I know, bu-”
kd “For gods sake, the people in our organization have gone on to work at the greatest companies the gaming industry has to offer, this isn’t a happy go lucky lets make friends and play patty cake baby club, if that’s what you were expecting, you should leave”
“jesus whats his problem, I didn’t even say anything, maybe this is a comedy bit? Maybe he thinks he’s being funny by being a douchebag?”
Mc “pshhhh alright dude lmaoooo”
“I look at my fellow club members and motion to Kendrick”
Mc “can you believe this guy? Whats up his butt?”
“nobody is laughing, I’m starting to figure out that this isn’t a comedy thing. Oh god think I’ve made this already uncomfortable situation worse”
Kd “get out”
Mc “I-Im sorry, i thought we were doing a bit”
Kd “a bit?”
Mc “l-like you were joking”
Kd “why would I be joking?”
Mc “c-cuz u were being super serious, I-I thought you were trying to scare us”
Kd “I never joke. You might think that your game, and probably your life, Is a joke, but I’m actually trying to get things done”
“dang he didn’t have to bring my life into this, I guess he’s right though, still he didn’t have to be mean”
Mc “m-my bad dude, I just misread the situation is all, I’m sorry”
Kd “its okay, just don’t make the mistake again, get to producing, we meet here next week at the same time, dismissed”
“I already hate college, I knew I should have gone to UC Riverside”
(Kendrick is detached and blunt. Recognizes the potential of the game, but not the protagonist herself)






(Scene 2)

--A sky or something?--

"I definitely didn't like him, but I couldn't say I hated him either."
"Kendrick was an amazing producer, no doubt about it. But as a team-mate... not so much."
"A couple meetings had passed. We're 2 weeks into the game's development."
"At this point, I'd hoped he would've lightened up around us, or at least be more bearable to be around."
"But nothing changed. Kendrick's still as cold as ever."
"After communicating with him these past few days, I'd gotten used to his rude remarks towards my work ethics."
"They stung at first, sure, but objectively speaking, they were all valid."
"I mean, that doesn't mean he couldn't have been a little nicer about it."

"(So long as things keep going like this, I can pull through.)"
